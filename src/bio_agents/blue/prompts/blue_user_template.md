# Writing Task
Using all information above, write the final answer that **exactly matches the output format and requirements requested in the Problem**.

Mandatory rules:
- If the problem lists numbered requirements (e.g., "(1)...(5)"), **preserve the numbering/structure** in your answer.
- If the problem asks for a strategy/pipeline/analysis plan, include **concrete steps, inputs, outputs, metrics, and caveats**.
- If data files are mentioned, describe **what to read and what to compute** (procedure/algorithm-level; not necessarily code).
- Explicitly state **assumptions/limitations** where uncertainty or missing information exists.
- **Write in English.**

**Output only the final answer text.**
