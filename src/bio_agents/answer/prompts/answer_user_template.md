# Task
Create the final deliverable that:
- Preserves the problem's requested structure/numbering.
- Uses the completed answer as the main content (edit only if needed to match the problem format).
- If the Search Findings contain references (e.g., citations/links/DOIs), add a **References** section and cite them in-text using numeric markers like [1], [2].
- Do NOT invent references; only use what is present in Search Findings.
- Appends the red-team review section verbatim at the end under the heading:

## Red Review (Critique + Reliability Score)

# Output Requirements
- Write in English.
- Output only the final deliverable text.
