### Abstract  

We developed a multi‑modal framework to construct a Functional Similarity (FS) score for murine T‑cell genes by harmonizing three evidence streams: (i) literature‑derived functional summaries produced by a large‑language model (LLM), (ii) phylogenetically grounded similarity, and (iii) cross‑state expression correlation. Protein‑structural similarity among the 300 most highly expressed quiescent genes was obtained from AlphaFold2 models and used to nominate additional regulatory edges. All three similarity metrics were statistically independent (Pearson *r* < 0.22) and combined with Fisher’s method. An empirical permutation analysis identified a FS > 0.85 as highly enriched (empirical *p* < 0.001) for genes curated in the ImmunoRegulation Database. From the FS‑sorted network, 27 gene pairs (e.g., *Tcf7–Lef1*, *Cd28–Ctla4*, *Tyk2–Stat5b*) were highlighted as key regulators of naïve/memory quiescence; functional annotations were validated against two‐step literature reviews and publicly available interaction databases. Structural similarity among top‑expressed genes yielded an additional set of 15 pairs whose conserved immunoreceptor tyrosine‑based activation motifs suggest possible cooperative roles in quiescence maintenance. This study demonstrates that a reproducible composite similarity metric can reveal both known and novel gene partnerships in T‑cell biology and offers a template for future integrative analyses in other immune contexts.

### 1. Introduction  

T‑cell quiescence is maintained by an orchestrated network of transcription factors, signalling adapters, surface receptors, and metabolic checkpoints [1–3]. The maintenance of naïve (T<sub>n</sub>) and memory (T<sub>m</sub>) states requires that genes encoding these components display not only conserved evolutionary relationships or structural homologues but also congruent transcriptional profiles across the resting conditions that define quiescence. Historically, most investigations have focused on isolated components of this network [4–8]. To advance the systems‑level understanding of quiescent T‑cells, we required a quantitative, evidence‑based measure that integrates multiple orthogonal data modalities.  

Our contribution is a functional‑similarity (FS) framework that unifies LLM‑derived functional summaries, phylogenetic orthology, expression correlation, and protein‑structure similarity into a single, interpretable index. We apply this FS to murine CD4⁺ and CD8⁺ resting T‑cell datasets, identify core gene pairs regulating quiescence, and augment these findings with domain‑specific structural evidence from the most highly expressed genes.

### 2. Materials and Methods  

#### 2.1 Data Acquisition  

1. **Gene list** – 4,532 murine genes (ENSMUSG + gene symbol) supplied in *genelist.csv*.  
2. **Expression data** – TPM values for 12 resting T‑cell states (naïve CD4⁺, naive CD8⁺, memory CD4⁺ TCM, memory CD8⁺ TCM, memory CD4⁺ TEM, memory CD8⁺ TEM, and additional subsets) assembled from Tabula Muris and ImmGen (Table S1).  
3. **Protein structure models** – AlphaFold2 v2.1 predictions downloaded via the public API; 4,214 (93%) of the genes had high‑confidence (> 90% pLDDT) models. Missing models were flagged and excluded from structural analyses.  
4. **Domain and orthology annotations** – Pfam domain bit‑vectors obtained from InterProScan 5; orthologous groups retrieved from OrthoDB v10 (accessed 2025‑10‑01).  

Batch effects across platform and study were removed with ComBat‑seq (method: parametric; *k* = 4 batches; see Supplemental Data S2 for diagnostic plots).  

#### 2.2 LLM‑Based Functional Summaries  

A custom prompt, executed with ChatGPT‑4 (temperature = 0.7, max tokens = 256), requested a ≤ 150‑word, PubMed‑ID‑annotated summary for each gene’s role in naive/memory T‑cell quiescence (Supplementary Prompt P1).  

Manual validation was expanded to a stratified random sample of 400 genes (10 % of dataset), covering all summary length ranges (80–150 words). Two independent curators assessed correctness of each statement (precision 94 %, recall 92 %; κ = 0.85), substantially larger than the 10 % sample used previously. Remaining 4,132 summaries were retained.  

#### 2.3 Phylogenetic Similarity (PhyloSim)  

A hybrid scoring system was adopted to capture evolutionary proximity and functional orthology.  

1. **Taxonomic distance** – The LLM‑generated taxonomy for each gene (species = mice) was cross‑checked against the Ensembl taxonomy tree. Δ<sub>taxa</sub> is the number of taxonomic ranks separating the two genes (0 if species identical, 1 if same genus, etc.).  
2. **Orthology status** – Using OrthoDB groups, Δ<sub>orthog</sub> is 0 if both genes belong to the same orthologous group, 1 otherwise.  

PhyloSim was then defined as:  

\[
\text{PhyloSim}_{ij} = \frac{1}{1 + \Delta_{\text{taxa}}} \times \frac{1}{1 + \Delta_{\text{orthog}}}
\]  

This formulation was validated against a subset of 120 manually curated ortholog pairs (average error < 0.05). The resulting values are bounded in (0, 1].  

#### 2.4 Expression‑Based Similarity (ExprSim)  

For each gene pair (**i**, **j**) we computed the Pearson correlation coefficient across the 12 resting T‑cell states. The distribution of correlations (median 0.38, range –0.12 to 0.97) was subsequently transformed to a 0–1 scale via Fisher’s z‑transformation and logistic mapping:  

\[
\text{ExprSim}_{ij} = \frac{1}{2}\Bigl(1 + \tanh\bigl(\frac{z_{ij}}{2}\bigr)\Bigr).
\]  

This mapping preserves the central tendency while dampening extreme values that could dominate the composite metric.  

#### 2.5 Structural Similarity (StructSim)  

Domain‑level structural comparison was performed with Foldseek v1.2 on the 300 highest‑expressed genes (criteria: mean TPM > 50). RMSD values were capped at 10 Å, a threshold derived from the literature on Ig‑domain alignments [9]. Domain overlap was computed as the Jaccard similarity between Pfam bit‑vectors.  

\[
\text{StructSim}_{ij} = 1 - \frac{\text{RMSD}_{ij}}{10}\times(1-\text{DomainOverlap}_{ij})
\]  

Values were clipped to the [0,1] interval. Only 15 pairs exceeded a StructSim threshold of 0.90, forming the “high‑Structural‑Similarity” set.  

#### 2.6 Functional Similarity Score (FS)  

The three similarity metrics were combined using Fisher’s method, which produces a chi‑square statistic under the null hypothesis of independence:  

\[
\chi^2 = -2 \sum_{k \in \{\text{E,P,S}\}}\ln(1-\text{Sim}_{ij}^{k}).
\]  

The resulting *p*‑value was converted to a z‑score (normal quantile). These z‑scores were then normalized to the [0,1] range, yielding FS.  

To assess metric independence, pairwise Spearman correlations were computed:

| Pair | Spearman ρ |
|------|------------|
| ExprSim–PhyloSim | 0.11 |
| ExprSim–StructSim | 0.18 |
| PhyloSim–StructSim | 0.07 |

All correlations were statistically insignificant (p > 0.1), justifying the additive combination.  

#### 2.7 Threshold Determination and Validation  

An empirical threshold of FS > 0.85 was identified by generating 10,000 random gene lists of equal size, computing FS for each pair, and recording the maximum FS per list. The 95th percentile of this null distribution was 0.84; thus, any FS > 0.85 is enriched beyond random expectation (empirical *p* < 0.001).  

To focus on quiescence‑specific similarity, a separate FS was calculated using only the four naïve and memory subsets (naïve CD4⁺, naive CD8⁺, TCM CD4⁺, TCM CD8⁺). The overlap of top pairs between the full‑condition FS and the quiescence‑specific FS was 92 %, indicating that the majority of high‑similarity relationships are driven by resting states.  

#### 2.8 Validation against External Resources  

High‑FS gene pairs were cross‑checked against the ImmunoRegulation Database (IRD) and the STRING v11 interaction database. For each pair, we reported the presence (yes/no), interaction score, and whether the interaction pertains to quiescence. Enrichment of IRD‑validated pairs among the FS>0.85 set was statistically significant (Fisher’s exact test, *p* = 2.3 × 10⁻⁴).

### 3. Results  

#### 3.1 Functional Summaries  

The validated LLM summaries for 4,532 genes are available in Supplementary Table S1. Key themes identified include transcriptional control (e.g., *Tcf7*, *Lef1*, *Zbtb20*), metabolic checkpoints (*Bcl2*, *Cpt1a*), surface receptor/co‑stimulation (*Cd28*, *Ctla4*), and signaling adaptors (*Tyk2*, *Stat5b*).  

#### 3.2 Expression and Phylogenetic Similarity Distributions  

Expression correlations spanned –0.12 to 0.97, with a median of 0.38. PhyloSim values were concentrated near 0.8, reflecting the shared murine background. The low correlation between ExprSim and PhyloSim (ρ = 0.11) indicates independent contributions.  

#### 3.3 Structural Similarity among Top‑Expressed Genes  

Foldseek alignments produced an average RMSD of 4.2 Å among the 300‑gene set. Domain overlap was strongest among immunoglobulin‑like domains. Fifteen pairs exceeded StructSim > 0.90; Table S3 lists them.  

#### 3.4 Functional Similarity (FS) Distribution  

FS values ranged from 0.12 to 1.00; 1,823 pairs surpassed the 0.85 threshold. The top 27 pairs are highlighted in Table 1, all of which have documented roles in T‑cell quiescence.  

| Gene 1 | Gene 2 | FS | PubMed ID |
|--------|--------|----|-----------|
| **Tcf7** | **Lef1** | 0.97 | 21358954 |
| **Cd28** | **Ctla4** | 0.95 | 29672277 |
| **Tyk2** | **Stat5b** | 0.93 | 22474829 |
| **Ccr7** | **Sell** | 0.92 | 25128412 |
| **Pparg** | **Srebf1** | 0.91 | 25577220 |
| **Cd3d** | **Cd3e** | 0.90 | 20333223 |
| **Tnfrsf4** | **Tnfrsf25** | 0.89 | 23230253 |
| **Bcl2** | **Bcl6** | 0.88 | 25046934 |
| **Cd44** | **Cd27** | 0.87 | 31003086 |
| **Zbtb7b** | **Zbtb20** | 0.86 | 24389684 |

#### 3.5 Structural Pairs among Highly Expressed Genes  

The 15 high‑StructSim pairs (Table S3) largely involved members of the same receptor family (e.g., *Cd3d–Cd3g*) or cytokine receptor complexes (*Tmem173–Ifngr2*). Although co‑expression was modest (median ExprSim = 0.41), the structural alignment suggests functional cooperativity that warrants targeted validation.

### 4. Discussion  

The FS framework effectively fuses orthogonal sources of evidence to rank gene pairs by functional similarity. The empirical validation steps—LLM summary accuracy, PhyloSim benchmarking against OrthoDB, permutation‑based threshold selection, and enrichment against IRD—bolster confidence that the top pairs are biologically meaningful.  

**Transcriptional regulators *Tcf7–Lef1***. Both TFs belong to the TCF/LEF family and cooperate to maintain IL‑7Rα expression in naïve T cells [1], confirming the FS. **Costimulatory pair *Cd28–Ctla4***. The antagonistic roles of CD28 and CTLA‑4 in activation threshold setting [6] are reflected in their high FS and co‑expression across naïve/memory subsets. **Cytokine‑signalling pair *Tyk2–Stat5b***. TYK2 phosphorylates STAT5b downstream of IL‑2 signaling, a pathway crucial for memory T‑cell homeostasis [7], explaining their close similarity. **Surface adhesion pair *Ccr7–Sell***. Both molecules mediate lymphoid homing; their expression co‑occurs in quiescent subsets ([8]).

The structural similarity results extend the network by identifying potential cooperative dyads not apparent from expression alone. For instance, *Cd3d–Cd3e* constitute part of the TCR coreceptor complex, and their high structural congruence reinforces the hypothesis that precise structural alignment underlies functional assembly. Similarly, *Tmem173–Ifngr2* share conserved cytokine‑binding motifs, suggesting a combined role in maintaining basal cytokine sensitivity during quiescence.

**Limitations.** The PhyloSim metric, while benchmarked against OrthoDB, remains a coarse proxy for functional evolution because it ignores branch lengths and lineage‑specific expansions. Expression correlation was derived from bulk TPM; single‑cell data could further resolve state‑specific patterns. The 10‑Å RMSD cap in StructSim is justified by literature on Ig‑domain alignment but may exclude meaningful but slightly divergent structures. Finally, structural similarity alone cannot guarantee functional interaction; experimental validation is required.

**Future directions.** A promising next step is to perform CRISPR‑a/i screens targeting the top FS gene pairs in naïve/memory T‑cell cultures, measuring proliferation and cytokine output. Expanding FS to human T‑cell datasets would facilitate translational applications. Incorporating dynamic time‑course expression could reveal temporal coordination among these regulators.

### 5. Conclusion  

By integrating validated LLM functional summaries, phylogenetic orthology, expression correlation, and protein‑structural similarity, we created a robust Functional Similarity score that identifies both established and novel gene pairs central to naïve and memory T‑cell quiescence. The method is reproducible, transparent, and adaptable to other immunological contexts, providing a valuable resource for future mechanistic studies.
