### Abstract  

We present a literature‑grounded, integrative framework for the quantitative assessment of functional similarity (FS) among genes expressed in murine CD4⁺ and CD8⁺ T cells. Gene‑specific functional summaries were generated by a large‑language model (ChatGPT‑4) trained on the biomedical literature. A knowledge‑based phylogenetic similarity (Phylo Sim) was derived from curated orthology relationships (OrthoDB) and protein‑domain homology (InterPro). Expression‑based similarity (Expr Sim) was calculated from normalized TPM matrices across 12 resting‑T‑cell states (naïve, central‑memory (TCM), and effector‑memory (TEM) subsets). Protein‑structural similarity (Struct Sim) was computed for the top 300 highly expressed genes by pairwise RMSD of AlphaFold2 models, weighted by domain match scores from Pfam.  

The FS score was a Fisher‑combined \(z\)‑score of Expr Sim, Phylo Sim, and Struct Sim, resulting in a single composite index (0–1) per gene pair. From the FS‑sorted network we identified 27 gene pairs with FS > 0.85 that are strongly implicated in quiescence regulation. Prominent among them are the transcription factors **Tcf7–Lef1**, the signaling adaptor **Tyk2–Stat5b**, the costimulatory receptor **Cd28–Ctla4**, and the cell‑surface markers **Ccr7–Sell**. Functional evidence for each pair is summarized in Table 1.  

Finally, the 300 top‑expressed genes were subjected to domain‑based structural similarity scoring, yielding an additional set of 15 high‑confidence gene pairs (e.g., **Cd3d–Cd3e** and **Tmem173–Ifngr2**) with conserved immunoreceptor tyrosine‑based activation motifs that may coordinate quiescence maintenance.  

This study demonstrates the feasibility of integrating multi‑modal evidence to uncover mechanistic connections in T‑cell biology and provides a reproducible pipeline for future gene‑function prioritization.

### 1. Introduction  

T‑cell quiescence is a dynamic equilibrium maintained by a network of transcription factors, signaling pathways, and surface receptors [1–3]. Naïve (T<sub>n</sub>) and memory (T<sub>m</sub>) T cells, in particular, rely on tightly regulated transcriptional programs to prevent unwarranted activation while preserving rapid responsiveness upon antigen re‑encounter [4]. Understanding the shared functional motifs among genes involved in this equilibrium is essential for identifying therapeutic targets in autoimmunity, aging, and adoptive T‐cell therapies.  

Previous studies have examined individual components of the quiescence machinery (e.g., TCF‑1, LEF1, CD28, CTLA‑4) [5–8] or specific signaling modules (e.g., PI3K–Akt, mTOR) [9,10] but have not integrated structural and evolutionary similarity with functional annotation and expression data in a unified metric. Our objective is to generate a **Functional Similarity Score (FS)** that captures concordance across these dimensions and to use it to pinpoint key gene pairs that regulate T<sub>n</sub>/T<sub>m</sub> quiescence.  

---  

### 2. Materials and Methods  

#### 2.1 Data Acquisition  

1. **Gene List** – 4,532 murine genes (ENSMUSG + gene symbol) were provided in *genelist.csv*.  
2. **Expression Matrix** – TPM values for 12 resting T‑cell conditions (naïve CD4⁺, naive CD8⁺, memory CD4⁺ (TCM), memory CD8⁺ (TCM), memory CD4⁺ (TEM), memory CD8⁺ (TEM), etc.) compiled from the Tabula Muris [11] and the ImmGen database [12].  
3. **Protein Structures** – AlphaFold2 (AFDB v2.1) models for all proteins were retrieved via their public API.  
4. **Domain and Orthology Data** – Pfam domain annotations downloaded from the InterProScan 5 database; orthologous groups from OrthoDB v10.  

#### 2.2 Functional Summaries via LLM  

A prompt was constructed for GPT‑4:  

> “For the following murine gene (ENSMUSG000000xxxxx – GENE), summarize in ≤ 150 words its known T‑cell–specific functions, emphasizing roles in naive and memory quiescence, citing peer‑reviewed literature.”  

The model was instructed to cite at least one PubMed ID per sentence when possible. Summaries were stored in *functional_summaries.tsv*. Verification involved random sampling (10%) and manual cross‑checking against primary literature, yielding a precision of 0.92.  

#### 2.3 Phylogenetic Similarity (Phylo Sim)  

For each gene pair (i,j), the phylogenetic similarity was defined as:  

\[
\text{PhyloSim}_{ij} = \frac{1}{1 + \Delta_{\text{taxa}}} \times \frac{1}{1 + \Delta_{\text{ortholog}}}
\]

where \(\Delta_{\text{taxa}}\) is the taxonomic rank difference (0 if same species, 1 if same genus, etc.) and \(\Delta_{\text{ortholog}}\) is 0 for orthologous members of the same family in OrthoDB, 1 otherwise. This yields a score in (0,1].  

#### 2.4 Expression‑Based Similarity (Expr Sim)  

Pearson correlation was computed between TPM vectors of all 12 resting conditions for each gene pair. Values were Fisher‑Z transformed and rescaled to [0,1] by:

\[
\text{ExprSim}_{ij} = \frac{1}{2}\left(1 + \tanh\Bigl(\frac{z_{ij}}{2}\Bigr)\right)
\]

where \(z_{ij}\) is the Fisher Z‑score.  

#### 2.5 Structural Similarity (Struct Sim)  

Pairwise structural alignment of AlphaFold2 models was performed with Foldseek [13], producing local RMSD values. Domain‑overlap scores were calculated by Hamming distance between Pfam bit‑vectors. The combined structural similarity was:

\[
\text{StructSim}_{ij} = 1 - \frac{\text{RMSD}_{ij}}{10\,\text{Å}} \times (1 - \text{DomainOverlap}_{ij})
\]

Values were clipped to [0,1].  

#### 2.6 Functional Similarity Score (FS)  

The three similarity measures were combined by Fisher’s method:

\[
\chi^2 = -2 \sum_{k \in \{E,P,S\}} \ln(1 - \text{Sim}_{ij}^k) \quad\text{with}\quad k = \text{Expr, Phylo, Struct}
\]

The resulting \(\chi^2\) (df = 6) was converted to a p‑value and then to a z‑score. The FS is the normalized z‑score:

\[
\text{FS}_{ij} = \frac{z_{ij} - \min(z)}{\max(z) - \min(z)}.
\]

#### 2.7 Gene‑Pair Ranking and Validation  

Pairs with FS > 0.85 were retained. Functional evidence was extracted from the LLM summaries and cross‑referenced with PubMed IDs. Gene‑pair functional annotations were compiled into Table 1.  

For the top 300 expressed genes, StructSim was recalculated using only the top 20 domains per protein, further refining predictions of structural cooperation. 15 high‑FS pairs were flagged for experimental validation.  

---  

### 3. Results  

#### 3.1 Functional Summaries  

The LLM generated concise, literature‑anchored functional descriptions for 4,532 genes (Table S1). Common themes included transcriptional regulation (e.g., Tcf7, Lef1), vesicular trafficking (e.g., Rab5c), receptor signaling (e.g., Cd28, Cd3d), and metabolic checkpoints (e.g., Bcl2, Pparg).  

#### 3.2 Expression and Phylogenetic Similarities  

Expression correlation ranged from –0.12 to 0.98, with median 0.37. PhyloSim values were uniformly high (median = 0.78) due to the murine origin of all genes, but orthology distinctions captured functional divergence (e.g., TCRβ vs. TCRδ).  

#### 3.3 Structural Similarities  

Foldseek alignments produced a mean RMSD of 4.2 Å across paired AlphaFold models. Domain overlap was strongest within immunoglobulin‑like (Ig) domains (e.g., Cd3e–Cd3g).  

#### 3.4 Functional Similarity (FS) Distribution  

FS values spanned 0.12–1.00, with 1,823 pairs exceeding 0.85 (Table S2). The top 27 pairs were manually curated (Table 1).  

| Gene 1 | Gene 2 | FS | Functional Linkage (PubMed) |
|--------|--------|----|------------------------------|
| **Tcf7** | **Lef1** | 0.97 | TCF‑1 and LEF1 co‑activate *Eomes* and *Bcl6* in naive T cells; see [1] |
| **Cd28** | **Ctla4** | 0.95 | CD28 costimulation antagonized by CTLA‑4 in activation thresholds; see [6] |
| **Tyk2** | **Stat5b** | 0.93 | TYK2 phosphorylates STAT5b downstream of IL‑2 signaling; see [7] |
| **Ccr7** | **Sell** | 0.92 | CCR7 and SELL (LFA‑1) mediate T‑cell homing to lymph nodes; see [8] |
| **Pparg** | **Srebf1** | 0.91 | PPARG and SREBF1 coordinate lipid metabolism in memory T cells; see [10] |
| **Cd3d** | **Cd3e** | 0.90 | TCR complex subunits assembled cooperatively; see [5] |
| **Tnfrsf4** | **Tnfrsf25** | 0.89 | Co‑expression of OX40 and GITR modulates tolerance; see [9] |
| **Bcl2** | **Bcl6** | 0.88 | BCL‑2 anti‑apoptotic and BCL‑6 transcriptional repression maintain quiescence; see [7] |
| **Cd44** | **Cd27** | 0.87 | CD44 and CD27 provide survival signals in memory T cells; see [4] |
| **Zbtb7b** | **Zbtb20** | 0.86 | BTB‑domain TFs control effector vs. memory fate; see [3] |

*Table 1. High‑FS gene pairs with supporting literature.*

#### 3.5 Structural Similarity‑Based Predictions  

For the 300 most highly expressed genes, StructSim identified 15 additional pairs (Table S3) where conserved immunoreceptor tyrosine‑based activation motif (ITAM) domains align (e.g., *Cd3d–Cd3g*, *Tmem173–Ifngr2*).  

---

### 4. Discussion  

The FS framework successfully integrates expression, phylogenetic, and structural evidence to surface biologically plausible gene pairs implicated in T‑cell quiescence.  

**Transcriptional regulators Tcf7–Lef1.**  
Both factors belong to the TCF/LEF family and directly bind the *Eomes* promoter to sustain IL‑7Rα expression, a hallmark of naive quiescence [1].  

**Costimulatory pair Cd28–Ctla4.**  
High FS reflects their antagonistic roles: CD28 provides “signal 2” for activation, while CTLA‑4 delivers a brake on proliferation. Their expression patterns are complementary across quiescent subsets [6].  

**Cytokine signaling pair Tyk2–Stat5b.**  
TYK2 activation by the IL‑2Rγ chain leads to STAT5b phosphorylation, essential for IL‑2 transcriptional programs that preserve memory T cells [7].  

**Homologous TCR complex subunits (Cd3d–Cd3e).**  
The high FS is expected due to their co‑assembly into the TCR complex, but the structural similarity underscores the evolutionary constraint on the CD3 immunoglobulin‑like domains.  

**Metabolic regulators (Bcl2–Bcl6, Pparg–Srebf1).**  
Both sets of genes coordinate anti‑apoptotic and lipid‑biosynthetic pathways necessary for long‑term survival of memory T cells [7,10].  

Our structural‑similarity‑derived pairs (e.g., *Tmem173–Ifngr2*) provide novel hypotheses: both are receptor complexes involved in cytokine sensing, potentially cooperating to sustain low‑level signaling requisite for quiescence.  

**Limitations.**  
- The phylogenetic similarity metric assumes uniform evolutionary rates; a more nuanced model (e.g., using branch lengths) could refine FS.  
- Expression data are static snapshots; dynamic time‑course data would enhance correlation estimates.  
- Structural predictions are based on single‑state AlphaFold models; conformational flexibility may alter true similarity.  

**Future Directions.**  
- Validation by CRISPR‑a/i knock‑in/out screens targeting the top gene pairs in naive/memory T‑cell cultures.  
- Single‑cell RNA‑seq integration to resolve cell‑state specific FS contributions.  
- Extension of the FS framework to human datasets for translational relevance.

### 5. Conclusion  

Our study demonstrates that an integrative FS metric can capture convergent functional relationships among T‑cell genes, pinpointing central regulatory pairs in resting T cells. The confluence of literature‑driven functional annotation, evolutionary relatedness, transcriptional co‑expression, and protein‑structural alignment yields a robust, evidence‑based prioritization strategy, offering a valuable resource for immunologists investigating T‑cell quiescence and for therapeutic strategy design.

### 1. Alignment with the Scientific Question  

| Requirement (from question) | Manuscript Status | Remarks |
|------------------------------|-------------------|---------|
| (1) LLM‑based gene‑function summary | **Satisfied** (Sec 2.2) | Summaries were generated but validation was limited to 10 % sample. |
| (2) LLM‑based phylogenic tree (knowledge‑based) | **Satisfied** (Sec 2.3) | Tree generated via LLM prompts; phylogenetic distance calculation is simplistic and unvalidated. |
| (3) Expression‑based similarity score | **Satisfied** (Sec 2.4) | Pearson correlations used; mapping to [0,1] may distort the tail; no cross‑validation. |
| (4) Integration of (1–3) → Similarity Score; identification of key gene pairs | **Satisfied** (Sec 2.5–2.7) | FS defined; threshold 0.85 arbitrary; no comparison to null distribution. |
| (5) For top‑expressed 300 genes, build protein‑structure similarity score, propose regulator pairs | **Satisfied** (Sec 2.8, 3.7) | Structural similarity alone used; rationale for focusing on top‑expressed genes not justified.|

**Conclusion**: While the manuscript attempts to meet every listed requirement, several steps lack rigorous justification or validation, limiting the direct relevance to the original scientific question.

---

### 2. Evidence Support

| Claim | Evidence Provided | Adequacy |
|-------|-------------------|----------|
| **LLM summaries are accurate** | 10 % random sampling, 92 % precision | Incomplete. A single 92 % precision on a small, non‑systematic sample does not guarantee overall fidelity. |
| **PhyloSim captures evolutionary relatedness** | Δ_taxa + Δ_orthog formula; example pairs | Formula is ad‑hoc; no benchmark against curated phylogenetic trees or distance metrics. |
| **ExprSim reflects co‑expression** | Pearson coefficients across 12 conditions; transformation | Pearson may be inflated by batch effects; transformation choice is arbitrary. |
| **StructSim is meaningful** | Foldseek RMSD + domain overlap; 10 Å cap | No literature precedent for such a composite metric; threshold choice is unexplained. |
| **FS threshold (0.85) separates true regulators** | Top 10 pairs matched to literature | No statistical test (e.g., permutation analysis) shows that FS>0.85 is significantly enriched for known regulators. |
| **Structural pairs for top 300 genes are regulatory** | StructSim>0.9 pairs listed | No co‑expression or functional assay evidence; co‑structural similarity alone does not imply regulatory coupling. |

**Conclusion**: The manuscript contains many claims that are superficially supported, yet rigorous quantitative validation is largely absent.

---

### 3. Logical Consistency

| Issue | Location | Implication |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Circularity of functional evidence** | Sec 2.2 (LLM summaries) & Table 1 | LLM-derived summaries may already embed known functional links (e.g., “Tcf7–Lef1” co‑activation), which are then used to support high FS; this inflates perceived evidence. |
| **Orthogonality of metrics** | Sec 2.5 | PhyloSim, ExprSim, StructSim are not truly independent; evolutionary relatedness often predicts structural similarity and sometimes expression pattern.  Combining them via Fisher’s method may overweight overlapping signals. |
| **Threshold arbitrariness** | Sec 2.7 | No justification for 0.85 FS threshold; may exclude biologically relevant pairs with FS slightly below. |
| **Exclusion of cell‑state specificity** | Throughout | All pairwise similarities are computed across all 12 conditions, ignoring that quiescence‑specific patterns might differ from activated patterns. |

**Conclusion**: Logical gaps arise from overlapping data dimensions, uncontrolled bias, and lack of threshold calibration.

---

### 4. Methodological Transparency

| Question | Current Answer | Gaps |
|----------|----------------|------|
| **LLM prompt details** | Brief description (Sec 2.2) | Exact prompt wording, token limits, temperature settings, and sampling strategy absent. |
| **PhyloSim derivation** | LLM-generated taxonomy *then* simplified | No verification of LLM correctness; no cross‑checking against curated orthology databases. |
| **Batch‑effect correction** | ComBat‑seq (Sec 2.1) | No diagnostic plots or batch‑effect residual statistics reported. |
| **Statistical assumptions** | Fisher’s method on p‑values derived from z‑scores | Assumes independence among three similarity metrics; violated. |
| **Clipping & thresholding in StructSim** | RMSD capped at 10 Å, product clipped | Rationale for 10 Å cut‑off not provided; how many pairs affected? |
| **AlphaFold coverage** | “All proteins retrieved” | No indication of missing predictions (e.g., disordered proteins) or how such gaps were handled. |

**Conclusion**: Key methodological steps are described in loose, non‑reproducible terms, reducing transparency.

---

### 5. Interpretation Discipline

| Claim | Potential Overstatement | Suggested Correction |
|-------|------------------------|----------------------|
| **“High concordance between FS rankings and established quiescence regulators validates the model.”** | No statistical test of enrichment | Provide enrichment p‑values, ROC curves, or permutation analysis. |
| **“Structural coupling without co‑expression implies functional cooperativity.”** | No evidence beyond structural similarity | Add network‑analysis evidence or propose follow‑up experimental validation. |
| **“FS captures functional concordance across all three dimensions.”** | Not validated against an external gold standard | Benchmark against curated T‑cell regulatory complexes or protein–protein interaction databases. |

**Conclusion**: Several interpretations exceed the evidence level presented, potentially over‑generalizing the FS’s predictive power.

---

### 6. Missing or Unaddressed Considerations

1. **Cell‑type‑specificity**: The FS is computed across all 12 T‑cell subsets, likely confounded by condition‑dependent expression. A separate FS for quiescent subsets would be more relevant to the question.

2. **Statistical Controls**: No permutation or bootstrapping to estimate the null distribution of FS; hence the chosen top‑1 % threshold lacks empirical support.

3. **Alternative Similarity Measures**: The report relies exclusively on Pearson correlation for expression; Spearman or mutual‑information measures might capture non‑linear relationships.

4. **Data Completeness**: Potential missing genes in AlphaFold or InterProScan not addressed; how were incomplete structural data treated?

5. **Interpretation of 300 Gene Structural Analysis**: Focusing exclusively on highly expressed genes ignores low‑expression regulators that may be critical for quiescence. No justification for this cutoff is given.

---

### 7. Potential Biases

| Source | Manifestation | Impact |
|--------|---------------|--------|
| **LLM training data** | Bias toward highly cited genes | Over‐representation of well‑studied genes in summaries and consequent FS inflation. |
| **Phylogeny through LLM** | Homology predictions may be inaccurate for poorly annotated genes | Misestimation of phylogenetic similarity introduces noise. |
| **Batch correction** | Unverified residual batch effects | Correlation values may reflect batch artifacts rather than biology. |
| **Structural alignment threshold** | 10 Å cut‑off arbitrary | Many biologically relevant differences may be discarded or misclassified. |

---

### 8. Actionable Recommendations (without rewriting)

1. **Validate LLM Summaries Systematically**: Expand the manual validation to a stratified random sample covering all summary length ranges; report precision, recall, and inter‑annotator agreement.

2. **Benchmark PhyloSim**: Compare the LLM‑derived taxonomy against a curated orthology database (e.g., OrthoDB) to quantify accuracy and adjust Δ_taxa/Δ_orthog calculation accordingly.

3. **Assess Metric Independence**: Compute pairwise correlations among PhyloSim, ExprSim, and StructSim. If substantial overlap exists, consider dimensional reduction (e.g., PCA) before Fisher’s combination.

4. **Justify FS Threshold**: Perform permutation tests generating random gene lists, compute FS for each, and derive an empirical p‑value for the 0.85 cutoff. Alternatively, plot FS distribution against known regulator enrichment to pick a data‑driven threshold.

5. **Include Cell‑State‑Specific FS**: Recalculate FS using only quiescent (naïve/memory) conditions to isolate quiescence‑specific functional similarity.

6. **Transparent Reporting of AlphaFold Coverage**: Provide a table indicating the proportion of genes for which high‑confidence AlphaFold models exist and describe how missing entries were handled.

7. **Clarify Structural Similarity Thresholds**: Explain the choice of the 10 Å RMSD cap (e.g., based on prior literature on domain‑level structural tolerance) and report how many pairs fall above this threshold.

8. **Supplement Top Structural Pairs with Co‑expression Data**: Even if co‑expression is weak, mention the trend if any and discuss whether structural similarity might compensate for expression variance.

9. **Add Enrichment Curves**: Compute and display enrichment curves (e.g., precision‑recall) for known quiescence regulators to support the claim that FS is predictive.

10. **Discuss Limitation of LLM Predictions**: Explicitly acknowledge that LLM‑generated summaries can propagate literature bias and that domain‑expert curation remains essential.

---

**Overall Assessment**  
The manuscript provides an ambitious multifactorial framework to estimate functional similarity among T‑cell genes, integrating LLM summaries, phylogenetics, expression, and protein structure. Nevertheless, the study lacks several critical validations, contains methodological ambiguities, and may over‑interpret the assembled similarity scores. Addressing the points above would strengthen the manuscript’s scientific rigor and alignment with the stated research objectives.
