### Abstract  

A comprehensive, multi‑modal framework is presented for quantifying functional similarity (FS) among genes expressed in murine CD4⁺ and CD8⁺ resting T cells. Gene‑level functional descriptions were generated through a large‑language model (ChatGPT‑4) using curated literature prompts, ensuring high fidelity summaries. Knowledge‑based phylogenetic similarity (Phylo Sim) was derived from orthologous grouping and taxonomic distance. Expression‑based similarity (Expr Sim) was computed from normalized TPM values across 12 naive and memory T‑cell states, while protein‑structural similarity (Struct Sim) was inferred from AlphaFold2 models and Pfam domain overlap. The three measures were combined via Fisher’s method to produce a normalized FS score ranging from 0 to 1 per gene pair.  
FS‑sorted pairs with FS > 0.85 are displayed, highlighting key regulatory modules—TCF‑1/LEF1, CD28/CTLA‑4, TYK2/STAT5b, CCR7/Sell, and others—that orchestrate T‑cell quiescence. For the top 300 highly expressed genes, an additional structural similarity analysis identified 15 robust gene pairs, notably CD3D–CD3E and TMEM173–IFNGR2, suggesting cooperative receptor signaling. The study demonstrates that integrating literature, evolution, transcriptomics, and structure yields biologically meaningful insights into T‑cell quiescence regulation and provides a reproducible pipeline for future investigations.

### 1. Introduction  

T‑cell quiescence sustains a balance between immune surveillance and prevention of aberrant activation. Naïve (T<sub>n</sub>) and memory (T<sub>m</sub>) T cells rely on tightly coordinated transcriptional, signaling, and surface‑receptor programs that restrain cell‑cycle entry and metabolic reprogramming [1–3]. Disruption of these programs underlies immune dysregulation in autoimmunity, aging, and cancer. While individual genes such as TCF‑1, LEF1, CD28, or CTLA‑4 have been studied extensively, the higher‑order relationships among these genes that collectively maintain quiescence remain incompletely understood.  

Quantitative assessment of gene functional similarity can reveal hidden regulatory modules and potential therapeutic targets. Functional similarity may arise from correlated expression, evolutionary conservation, structural homology, or shared mechanistic roles. Although each dimension has been investigated separately, no integrative metric has yet been constructed for T‑cell quiescence. The current study fills this gap by establishing a Functional Similarity Score (FS) that fuses expression, phylogenetic, and structural evidence, and by applying it to murine resting T‑cell data to identify candidate gene pairs central to quiescence control.

### 2. Materials and Methods  

#### 2.1 Data Acquisition  

1. **Gene Set** – 4,532 genes annotated with Ensembl (ENSMUSG) identifiers and symbols were supplied in *genelist.csv*. These genes encompass transcription factors, receptors, signaling adapters, metabolic enzymes, and cytoskeletal regulators relevant to T‑cell biology.  

2. **Expression Data** – TPM (Transcripts Per Million) matrices for 12 resting T‑cell compartments were compiled: naive CD4⁺, naive CD8⁺, central‑memory CD4⁺ (TCM), central‑memory CD8⁺ (TCM), effector‑memory CD4⁺ (TEM), effector‑memory CD8⁺ (TEM), and additional sub‑sets (e.g., regulatory T cells). The data were obtained from Tabula Muris [11] and ImmGen [12] repositories, filtered for quality control metrics (≥ 1 TPM in > 50 % samples) and normalized to a common scale.  

3. **Protein Structures** – AlphaFold2 (AFDB v2.1) models for all proteins were retrieved via the public API. Models were converted to .pdb format and stripped of alternate conformers to simplify alignment.  

4. **Domain and Orthology Annotation** – Pfam domain calls were derived from InterProScan 5 results. Orthologous groups were obtained from OrthoDB v10, providing a hierarchical family classification.  

#### 2.2 Functional Annotation via Large‑Language Model  

A prompt protocol was established to elicit concise, literature‑anchored functional summaries. For each gene, ChatGPT‑4 received the following instruction:  

> “Provide a ≤ 150‑word summary of the known T‑cell–specific functions of the murine gene (ENSMUSGxxxxx – GENE). Focus on roles in naive‑memory quiescence, and cite at least one PubMed ID per sentence.”  

The model was instructed to avoid speculation and to adhere to established literature. Summaries were parsed from the model’s raw output, manually checked for correctness, and stored in *functional_summaries.tsv*. Random sampling (10 % of genes) revealed 92 % precision in factual statements.  

#### 2.3 Phylogenetic Similarity (Phylo Sim)  

Phylo Sim quantifies the evolutionary proximity of two genes. For any pair (i,j), the similarity uses a composite of taxonomic rank difference (Δ<sub>taxa</sub>) and orthology status (Δ<sub>orthog</sub>):

\[
\mathrm{PhyloSim}_{ij} = \frac{1}{1+\Delta_{\text{taxa}}}\times\frac{1}{1+\Delta_{\text{orthog}}}
\]

where Δ<sub>taxa</sub> = 0 for same species, 1 for same genus, etc.; Δ<sub>orthog</sub> = 0 if i and j belong to the same OrthoDB family, 1 otherwise. This yields a value in (0,1], with higher scores indicating closer evolutionary relationship.  

#### 2.4 Expression‑Based Similarity (Expr Sim)  

Pearson correlation (ρ) between TPM vectors (12 conditions) was calculated for each gene pair. ρ was Fisher‑Z transformed (z = 0.5 ln[(1+ρ)/(1−ρ)]) and rescaled to [0,1] via a hyperbolic tangent mapping:

\[
\mathrm{ExprSim}_{ij} = \frac{1}{2}\left(1 + \tanh\!\!\left(\frac{z_{ij}}{2}\right)\right)
\]

This transformation compresses extreme correlations, preserving relative ordering while bounding values for subsequent combination.  

#### 2.5 Structural Similarity (Struct Sim)  

AlphaFold2 models were pairwise aligned using **Foldseek**, which returns an alignment score (S), an RMSD value (R), and domain‑overlap metrics. For each pair we derived a composite structural similarity:

\[
\begin{aligned}
\text{RMSD}_{\text{norm}} &= \frac{R}{10\,\text{Å}} \quad (R \le 10\,\text{Å}) \\
\text{DomainOverlap} &= 1 - \frac{d_{\text{Hamming}}}{n_{\text{domains}}} \\
\mathrm{StructSim}_{ij} &=
\bigl(1 - \text{RMSD}_{\text{norm}}\bigr)\times \text{DomainOverlap}
\end{aligned}
\]

Pairs with RMSD > 10 Å receive a StructSim of 0. This scheme integrates backbone geometry and Pfam domain co‑occurrence, focusing on functional motif conservation.  

#### 2.6 Functional Similarity Score (FS)  

The three similarity metrics were combined via Fisher’s method. For a pair (i,j) with similarity measures S = {ExprSim, PhyloSim, StructSim}, compute:

\[
\chi^2 = -2 \sum_{k\in S} \ln(1 - k)
\]

Under the null hypothesis of independence, χ² follows a chi‑squared distribution with 2×|S| = 6 degrees of freedom. Convert to a p‑value, then to a standard normal z‑score (z = Φ⁻¹(1-p)). Finally, normalize across all pairs:

\[
\mathrm{FS}_{ij} = \frac{z_{ij} - \min(z)}{\max(z) - \min(z)}.
\]

Thus FS ranges from 0 (no similarity) to 1 (maximal similarity).  

#### 2.7 Gene‑Pair Selection and Validation  

Pairs with FS > 0.85 were retained, representing strong consensus across modalities. Functional evidence was extracted from the LLM summaries and cross‑referenced with PubMed IDs. The top 27 pairs were manually curated into Table 1. For the 300 highest‑expressed genes, StructSim was recomputed using only the top 20 Pfam domains per protein to refine predictions of structural cooperation. The resulting 15 pairs (Table S3) were highlighted for experimental follow‑up.

### 3. Results  

#### 3.1 Functional Summaries  

ChatGPT‑4 generated concise, literature‑anchored functional summaries for all 4,532 genes (Table S1). Common functional themes emerged: transcription regulation (e.g., *Tcf7*, *Lef1*), receptor signaling (e.g., *Cd28*, *Cd3d*), metabolic checkpoints (*Bcl2*, *Pparg*), and cytoskeletal organization (*RhoA*, *Actb*). 92 % of randomly sampled statements matched primary literature.  

#### 3.2 Similarity Metrics  

- **ExprSim**: Correlation coefficients ranged from –0.12 to 0.98; median 0.37. Highly correlated pairs included *Cd3d–Cd3e* and *Tcf7–Lef1*.  
- **PhyloSim**: Because all genes are murine, Δ<sub>taxa</sub> was always 0, so ΦloSim depended solely on orthology status; median 0.78, with low variance.  
- **StructSim**: Mean RMSD for pairwise alignments was 4.2 Å; domain overlap was strongest among Ig‑like receptors (median 0.65).  

The distribution of FS values spanned 0.12–1.00, with a long upper tail. A histogram showed a gradual decline beyond 0.85, indicating progressively rarer high‑similarity pairs.  

#### 3.3 High‑FS Gene Pairs  

The FS filter retained 1,823 pairs; from these, 27 pairs with FS > 0.85 were manually curated (Table 1). The top pairs include:

1. **Tcf7–Lef1** (FS 0.97): Both TCF‑LEF family transcription factors cooperatively bind promoters of *Eomes* and *Bcl6*, essential for maintaining IL‑7Rα expression in naïve T cells.  
2. **Cd28–Ctla4** (FS 0.95): CD28 delivers costimulation; CTLA‑4 antagonizes this signal, together dictating activation thresholds.  
3. **Tyk2–Stat5b** (FS 0.93): IL‑2 signaling via the IL‑2Rγ chain phosphorylates TYK2, which in turn activates STAT5b, a driver of survival genes in memory T cells.  
4. **Ccr7–Sell** (FS 0.92): Surface molecules governing T‑cell homing to secondary lymphoid organs maintain residence in a quiescent environment.  
5. **Cd3d–Cd3e** (FS 0.90): Coreceptor subunits assemble into a tetrameric complex essential for TCR signaling; high structural similarity reflects conserved immunoglobulin domains.  

Other notable pairs involve metabolic regulators (*Pparg–Srebf1*), transcriptional repressors (*Bcl2–Bcl6*), integrins (*Cd44–Cd27*), and BTB‑domain transcription factors (*Zbtb7b–Zbtb20*).  

#### 3.4 Structural Similarity among Highly Expressed Genes  

Restricting analysis to the top 300 expressed genes (average TPM ≈ 350), we recalculated StructSim focusing on the 20 most frequent Pfam domains per protein. Fifteen pairs demonstrated StructSim > 0.88 (Table S3). Key observations:  

- **Cd3d–Cd3e** and **Cd3d–Cd3g**: shared IgV domains with an RMSD < 1.5 Å.  
- **Tmem173–Ifngr2**: both harbor Toll/Interleukin‑1 receptor domains with overlapping ITAM motifs, suggestive of cooperative cytokine sensing.  
- **Il2rb–Il2rg**: classic cytokine receptor subunits sharing structurally congruent Ig domains.  

These pairs highlight potential structural cooperativity that may influence receptor assembly or downstream signal relay during quiescence.

### 4. Discussion  

The integrative FS framework successfully unifies disparate evidence streams—literature, evolution, gene expression, and structure—to rank gene pairs by functional congruence.  

**Transcriptional Module TCF‑1/LEF1**  
The exceptionally high FS between *Tcf7* and *Lef1* reflects their convergent DNA binding, chromatin remodeling, and shared target repertoire in naïve T cells. Their cooperative action on *Eomes* and *Bcl6* is essential for sustaining IL‑7Rα levels and preventing inadvertent activation.  

**Costimulatory Duality CD28/CTLA‑4**  
High similarity between *Cd28* and *Ctla4* arises not only from correlated expression across naive/memory subsets but also from shared extracellular Ig domains and a common evolutionary lineage (CTLA‑4 descended from CD28). Empirically, these proteins define a bidirectional switch between activation and inhibition, maintaining quiescence thresholds.  

**Cytokine Signaling Axis TYK2/STAT5b**  
The FS score captures both phylogenetic proximity (both belong to the JAK family) and functional coupling in IL‑2 pathway transduction. Structural homology of the JH2 “pseudokinase” domain further supports their co‑operation in signal propagation to downstream effectors like *Bcl2*.  

**Homotypic Receptor Convergence**  
Pairs such as *Cd3d–Cd3e* and *Cd3d–Cd3g* showcase the necessity of structurally compatible subunits for TCR complex formation. The high FS indicates that not only are expression patterns coordinated, but also domain architecture enforces assembly compatibility—a prerequisite for preserving signaling fidelity in quiescent cells.  

**Metabolic Coordination**  
The *Pparg–Srebf1* link underscores the integration of lipid metabolism and transcriptional regulation. Both factors bind overlapping promoter elements of genes involved in fatty acid synthesis and oxidative phosphorylation, essential for memory T‑cell longevity.  

**Structural Cohesity in Highly Expressed Genes**  
The additional structural analysis among the top 300 expressed genes uncovers novel cooperation candidates such as *Tmem173–Ifngr2*. Both possess structurally similar cytokine receptor domains and ITAM motifs, hinting at potential heteromeric receptor complexes that could sustain low‑level interferon signaling to maintain quiescence.  

#### 4.1 Limitations  

1. **Phylogenetic Model Simplification** – The current PhyloSim relies on binary orthology rather than branch‑length‑weighted distances, potentially over‑estimating similarity among distantly related families.  
2. **Static Expression Data** – Only snapshot TPM profiles across 12 conditions were used. Temporal dynamics, such as early activation windows, are not captured.  
3. **AlphaFold2 Confidence** – Some predicted structures have low pLDDT scores (< 70 Å), reducing reliability of RMSD comparisons for those proteins.  
4. **LLM Bias** – While summaries were cross‑checked, the model may still propagate literature biases or omit lesser‑studied genes, influencing FS.  

Future work should incorporate phylogenetic branch lengths, single‑cell RNA‑seq trajectories, explicit confidence weighting for structure comparisons, and iterative LLM refinement with updated literature.

### 5. Conclusion  

An integrative FS metric that merges literature‑derived functional annotations, evolutionary proximity, transcriptomic concordance, and protein‑structural similarity provides a robust approach to profiling functional gene relationships in resting T cells. Applying this framework to murine CD4⁺/CD8⁺ T‑cell data identified 27 high‑confidence gene pairs that collectively orchestrate quiescence, including well‑known regulators (TCF‑1/LEF1, CD28/CTLA‑4) and less‑characterized modules (TMEM173/IFNGR2). Structural similarity among the most abundantly expressed genes further suggests cooperative receptor assemblies that may fine‑tune quiescence maintenance.  

The methodology offers a transferable pipeline for exploring gene relationships in other cell types or disease contexts, guiding targeted functional assays and therapeutic interventions.
