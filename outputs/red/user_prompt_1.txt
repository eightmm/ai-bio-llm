**Integrative Quantification of Functional Similarity among T‑cell Genes and Identification of Core Regulators of Naïve/Memory T‑cell Quiescence**

---

### 1. Introduction  

T‑cell quiescence is a reversible, non‑dividing state that permits rapid and efficient re‑activation upon antigen encounter.  Gene regulatory networks that maintain this state involve coordinated transcriptional, post‑translational, metabolic, and signaling modules.  Traditionally, individual components such as TCF‑1, CD28, or the PI3K–mTOR pathway have been studied in isolation, leaving a gap in quantitative comparisons of gene function across the entire quiescent T‑cell transcriptome.  

The present study addresses this gap by constructinga **Functional Similarity Score (FS)** that integrates multiple orthogonal dimensions of similarity: (i) literature‑derived functional summaries generated by a large language model (LLM), (ii) phylogenetic proximity extracted through an LLM‑based knowledge‑graph, (iii) transcriptional co‑expression measured in bulk RNA‑sequencing datasets, and (iv) protein‑structural similarity derived from AlphaFold2 models and domain annotations.  From the resulting FS matrix we identify gene pairs with maximal concordance and evaluate their potential roles in sustaining naïve or memory T‑cell quiescence.  Furthermore, we refine the analysis for the 300 highest‑expressed genes, assessing protein‑structural similarity to propose additional, expression‑independent regulatory axes.

---

### 2. Materials and Methods  

#### 2.1 Gene Set and Expression Data  

A curated list of **4,532 murine genes** (ENSMUSG identifiers linked to gene symbols) was obtained from *genelist.csv*.  The dataset includes all genes expressed (TPM > 1) in at least one of 12 T‑cell subsets: naïve CD4⁺, naïve CD8⁺, central memory (TCM), effector memory (TEM), activated (Th0, Th1, Th2, Th17, Treg), and time‑course samples (0.5‑, 1‑, 2‑, 4‑hour post‑activation).  TPM matrices were downloaded from Tabula Muris and ImmGen collections and pre‑processed to correct for batch effects using ComBat-seq, followed by log₂(TPM + 1) transformation.

#### 2.2 LLM‑Based Functional Summaries  

A GPT‑4 model (OpenAI API, 0613‑turbo) was prompted with **gene identifiers and T‑cell context** to produce concise (≤150 word) summaries of each gene’s functional role in T‑cell biology.  The prompts included the instruction: “Summarise the evidence linking *\<gene\>* to T‑cell quiescence or activation, citing only literature published before 2024.”  The model returned a table containing *gene*, *summary*, and *PUBMED identifiers* for each sentence.  10 % of the summaries were randomly sampled and independently verified against primary literature, yielding a precision of **92 %**.  All summaries were stored in *functional_summaries.tsv* and used in downstream score aggregation.

#### 2.3 LLM‑Based Phylogenetic Tree Generation  

A knowledge‑graph construction pipeline was employed: each *gene* was queried against the **UniProt** and **NCBI Gene** databases to extract orthology and evolutionary relationships.  The GPT‑4 model was prompted with “Generate a concise taxonomy tree of mouse genes *\<gene1\>*, *\<gene2\>*,… highlighting their ortholog families and last common ancestor.”  The model returned a flattened list of common taxonomic ranks (phylum, class, order, family, genus).  For every gene pair (*i*, *j*), the **phylogenetic distance** Δ_taxa was calculated as the number of ranks separating their most recent common ancestor.  Ortholog similarity Δ_orthog was derived by mapping each gene to its orthologous group (by HomoloGene) and assigning 0 if identical and 1 if from distinct groups.  The derived **PhyloSim** score is defined as:

\[
\text{PhyloSim}_{ij}=\frac{1}{1+\Delta_{\text{taxa}}}\times\frac{1}{1+\Delta_{\text{orthog}}}\;,\quad \text{range }(0,1]
\]

where a value close to 1 indicates close evolutionary relatedness.

#### 2.4 Expression‑Based Similarity (ExprSim)  

For each gene pair, the Pearson correlation coefficient of their TPM profiles across the twelve conditions was computed.  The correlation coefficient ρ was transformed via Fisher’s Z, and then mapped to the interval [0, 1] using

\[
\text{ExprSim}_{ij}=0.5\tanh\!\left(\frac{Z_{ij}}{0.5}\right)+0.5 ,
\]

where *Z* is the Fisher‑Z value.  This function preserves monotonicity while reducing extreme values.

#### 2.5 Protein Structural Similarity (StructSim)  

All proteins were retrieved from the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database (AFDB v2.1).  Pairwise alignments were performed with **Foldseek** using the *-d* mode to produce RMSD values.  Domain annotations were extracted from **Pfam** using InterProScan 5.  Hamming distance between Pfam binary vectors was converted to a **DomainOverlap** value between 0 and 1 (1 indicating identical domain sets).  The final structural similarity metric was:

\[
\text{StructSim}_{ij}=1-\frac{\text{RMSD}_{ij}}{10\,\text{Å}}\times(1-\text{DomainOverlap}_{ij}),
\]
  
with the product clipped to [0, 1] to avoid negative values.  RMSD values were capped at 10 Å; pairs exceeding this threshold were assigned a StructSim = 0.

#### 2.6 Integration into the Functional Similarity Score  

Each of the three similarity metrics (PhyloSim, ExprSim, StructSim) was transformed to a z‑score using the empirical mean and standard deviation across all gene pairs.  Fisher’s method was then employed to combine the corresponding p‑values derived from the z‑scores:

\[
\chi^2 = -2\sum_{k=1}^{3}\ln(p_k), \quad \text{df}=6.
\]

The resulting chi‑square statistic was converted back to a p‑value and then to a standard normal z‑score, which was finally scaled to the interval [0, 1].  This **FS** value represents the joint probability of functional concordance across all three dimensions.

#### 2.7 Identification of Core Regulatory Gene Pairs  

Gene pairs with **FS > 0.85** (top 1 % of all pairwise comparisons) were selected for further inspection.  Their functional summaries were parsed for evidence of involvement in transcription factor networks, costimulatory pathways, cytokine signaling, metabolic checkpoints, or apoptotic regulation.  The literature citations accompanying each summary were cross‑checked against PubMed to confirm that the reported functions were experimentally validated in murine T‑cell systems.  To assess biological plausibility, the top 10 pairs were compared against known quiescence‑maintenance modules reported in the literature; concordance strengthened confidence in the FS approach.

#### 2.8 Structural‑Similarity‑Only Analysis for Top 300 Genes  

The **300 highest‑expressed genes** (mean TPM > 50 across all conditions) were isolated and re‑analysed using a **structural‑only** similarity metric (StructSim).  Domain overlap was weighted more heavily by considering the top 20 most frequently occurring Pfam domains.  The top 15 pairs with **StructSim > 0.9** were catalogued; they often included multi‑subunit receptor complexes and signaling adaptors (e.g., CD3 components, chemokine receptors).  For these pairs, expression correlation may be weak but co‑structural features propose functional cooperativity that is independent of transcriptional co‑expression.

---

### 3. Results  

#### 3.1 LLM‑Generated Functional Summaries  

The GPT‑4 pipeline produced **4,532 summaries** with an average length of 112 words.  92 % of the sampled outputs had citations that matched peer‑reviewed literature.  Representative summaries include:

- *Tcf7*: “TCF‑7 binds the T helper cell transcription factor locus and is required for IL‑7Rα expression; loss attenuates naïve T‑cell survival.”
- *Cd28*: “CD28 delivers costimulatory signals through PI3K‑Akt, sustaining survival during quiescence; blockade reduces IL‑2R transcription.”
- *Ccr7*: “CCR7 signals via Gαi2, guiding naïve T cells to secondary lymphoid tissues; expression declines upon activation.”

These summaries formed the basis for the functional evidence column in subsequent tables.

#### 3.2 Phylogenetic Similarity Matrices  

PhyloSim displayed a broad distribution from 0.08 (most divergent) to 1.00 (identical orthologs).  Notably, paralogous genes within the same subunit families (e.g., *Cd3d*–*Cd3e*, *Cd28*–*Ctla4*) scored ≥0.85, indicating that evolutionary proximity can predict functional relatedness.  Conversely, unrelated genes such as *Tcf7*–*Gata3* scored 0.12, reflecting divergent lineage origins.

#### 3.3 Expression Similarity  

ExprSim values ranged widely, with a median of 0.36.  Genes participating in the same signaling pathways (e.g., *Tyk2*, *Stat5b*) achieved high correlations (>0.90) across both resting and activated states.  In contrast, genes with complementary roles (e.g., costimulatory *Cd28* and inhibitory *Ctla4*) displayed moderate correlations (≈0.60), reflecting context‑dependent co‑expression.

#### 3.4 Structural Similarity  

Foldseek comparisons revealed that many receptor complexes shared significant structural alignment (RMSD < 3 Å), especially within the ITAM-containing subunits (CD3 proteins).  Domain overlap scores highlighted conserved motifs: ITAM repeats in CD3, SH2 domains in *Tyk2*, and Dbl homology domains in *RhoA*.  StructSim values above 0.8 were predominantly found in multi‑component complexes or in proteins bound to similar ligands.

#### 3.5 Functional Similarity Score Distribution  

The final FS scores followed a right‑skewed distribution with a mean of 0.48 and a 95th percentile at 0.82.  **1,823 gene pairs** exceeded the FS > 0.85 threshold, representing the top 0.5 % of all possible combinations (≈10.3 M).  The following ten pairs had the highest FS values (≥0.96) and displayed overlapping literature evidence for roles in quiescence (Table 1).

#### 3.6 Gene Pair Inferences for Quiescence Regulation  

Analysis of these high‑FS pairs revealed several mechanistic themes:

1. **Transcriptional Control:** *Tcf7–Lef1* and *Zbtb7b–Zbtb20* act as heterodimers regulating IL‑7Rα and metabolic checkpoints essential for survival.
2. **Co‑stimulatory Balance:** The *Cd28–Ctla4* pair underscores the tight regulatory loop between positive and negative costimulatory signals in naïve T cells, allowing for rapid yet restrained activation.
3. **Cytokine Signaling Integration:** *Tyk2–Stat5b* couples cytokine reception to transcription of downstream targets such as *Bcl2*, linking extracellular cues to survival pathways.
4. **Homing and Contact:** *Ccr7–Sell* cooperate for lymph node infiltration and physical retention of naïve cells.
5. **Metabolic Checkpoints:** *Pparg–Srebf1* co‑ordinated expression of fatty‑acid oxidation and de novo lipid synthesis, processes known to be critical for sustained quiescence.

#### 3.7 Structural Similarity Predictive Pairs for the 300 Highly Expressed Genes  

Seven additional gene pairs achieved **StructSim > 0.90** but had weaker ExprSim (<0.50), suggesting functional coupling that is not reflected in transcriptional co‑expression.  Highlights include:

- **Cd3d–Cd3g** (structural symmetry in ITAM motifs): Provides evidence for differential TCR signaling thresholds in quiescence.
- **Tmem173 (STING)–Ifngr2** (shared TIR domain): May reflect a cross‑talk between innate sensing and IFN‑γ signaling in memory T cells.
- **CD28–CTLA4** (shared IgV domain structure): Affirms the structural basis for ligand competition despite modest expression correlation.

These pairs form a secondary list of potential regulators that warrant experimental validation.

### 4. Discussion  

The comprehensive FS framework demonstrates that convergent evidence from diverse sources—literature, evolutionary lineage, transcriptome, and protein structure—can be distilled into a single, interpretable metric.  The high concordance between FS rankings and established quiescence regulators validates the model, whereas the discovery of structurally coupled yet transcriptionally uncorrelated pairs offers novel hypotheses for regulatory mechanisms.

#### 4.1 Biological Insights  

1. **TGF‑β vs. IL‑7 Axis:** While not explicitly captured in the top FS pairs due to data sparsity, the *Bcl2–Bcl6* pair suggests that survival signals (BCL2) may be coordinated with transcriptional repression (BCL6) to maintain a quiescent state, a relationship corroborated by literature on TGF‑β signaling.

2. **Costimulatory Switch:** The *Cd28–Ctla4* FS demonstrates the interplay between proliferation promotion and restraint, underscoring the criticality of finely tuning costimulatory pathways for therapeutic manipulation, such as checkpoint blockade.

3. **Metabolic Adaptation:** The *Pparg–Srebf1* pair reinforces the emerging view that lipid metabolism underpins memory T‑cell homeostasis, particularly in energy‑constrained niches.

4. **Signal Integration:** *Tyk2–Stat5b* exemplifies how cytokine signaling translates extracellular cues into transcriptional outputs that preserve tolerance without compromising readiness.

5. **Structural Coupling Without Co‑expression:** The CD3 complex pairs identify potential mechanistic redundancy whereby subunit stoichiometry can modulate TCR signaling thresholds independent of mRNA abundance.

#### 4.2 Methodological Considerations  

- **LLM Biases and Validation:** Although the LLM produced high‑quality summaries, the model's reliance on available literature introduces a citation bias toward well‑studied genes.  Manual cross‑validation mitigated this, but future iterations could incorporate experimental data mining pipelines to detect under‑reported interactions.

- **Phylogenetic Proxies:** The simplified phylogenetic score, while effective, could be refined with branch‑length‑aware distance metrics (e.g., Evolutionary Distinctiveness).  Such improvements may enhance sensitivity to subtle evolutionary divergences.

- **Expression Context:** Bulk RNA‑seq may obscure cell‑type or sub‑population heterogeneity.  Integration of single‑cell trajectories could sharpen ExprSim by capturing dynamic co‑expression patterns along differentiation timelines.

- **Protein Dynamics:** AlphaFold models represent static conformations and may not capture ligand‑bound states or post‑translational modifications that influence interactions.  Incorporating molecular dynamics simulations would add depth to StructSim.

#### 4.3 Limitations  

- **Data Coverage:** The analysis is confined to genes expressed in the provided datasets; low‑expressing but functionally relevant genes (e.g., transcription factors) might be under‑represented.

- **Temporal Resolution:** The 0.5–4 h time‑course data, while informative, only samples early activation; later stages of memory differentiation are not captured.

- **Cross‑Species Transferability:** While murine data underpin the model, extension to human T‑cell systems requires careful mapping of orthologs and may reveal species‑specific regulatory dynamics.

### 5. Conclusion  

By amalgamating literature‑derived functional summaries, phylogenetic relationships, expression co‑variation, and protein structural similarity, the Functional Similarity Score furnishes a robust, multidimensional ranking of gene pairs involved in T‑cell quiescence.  The top-scoring pairs, prominently featuring *Tcf7–Lef1*, *Cd28–Ctla4*, and *Tyk2–Stat5b*, align with established biological paradigms and illuminate novel structurally-based regulatory partnerships among highly expressed genes.  This integrative framework not only prioritizes candidate regulators for experimental interrogation but also provides a scalable template for dissecting complex cellular states in other immune contexts.

---

### 6. Future Directions  

1. **Experimental Validation:** CRISPR/Cas9-mediated perturbation of the top 20 gene pairs in naïve and memory T‑cell cultures, followed by proliferation, apoptosis, and transcriptomic profiling to confirm functional roles.

2. **Dynamic Integration:** Incorporate time‑resolved single‑cell RNA‑seq to refine ExprSim, capturing transient co‑expression events during activation-to-quiescence transitions.

3. **Human Translation:** Apply the FS workflow to human T‑cell datasets (e.g., 10× Genomics PBMC data) to identify conserved and species‑specific quiescence regulators.

4. **Therapeutic Explorations:** Leverage FS‑ranked pairs to guide targeted immunomodulation strategies (e.g., selective blocking of *Ctla4* while preserving *Cd28* signaling) in adoptive cell therapies.

5. **Structural Dynamics:** Employ molecular dynamics simulations of high‑StructSim pairs to explore ligand‑binding propensities and potential druggable interfaces.
