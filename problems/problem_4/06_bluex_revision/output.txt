## (A) Analysis of IL-11 and IL-11 Interacting Factors Driving Pulmonary Fibrosis

### (A1) Role of IL-11 in Pulmonary Fibrosis and Aging
- **Pulmonary fibrosis (IPF):** IL-11 is consistently upregulated in fibrotic lung tissue and is required for fibroblast activation, fibroblast-to-myofibroblast differentiation, excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) protein synthesis, and progressive tissue stiffening. Genetic deletion of **IL11RA** or pharmacologic neutralization of IL-11 robustly attenuates fibrotic remodeling in multiple preclinical lung injury models. These data support a disease-modifying role in fibrosis *initiation and progression*.
- **Signaling characteristics:** IL-11 signals via a **hexameric IL-11/IL-11Rα/gp130 complex**, with **sustained ERK activation** as the dominant profibrotic driver (notably regulating post‑transcriptional ECM protein synthesis), and **JAK2/STAT3 signaling** contributing to inflammatory and pro-survival transcriptional programs.
- **Aging and senescence:** IL-11 expression increases with age across multiple tissues and functions as a **senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) component**, reinforcing ERK–mTORC1 and STAT3 signaling. In preclinical systems, IL-11 blockade reduces molecular senescence markers (e.g., p16, p21) and improves age-associated functional decline.
- **Fibrosis–aging coupling:** IL-11 integrates profibrotic cues (TGF‑β, inflammatory cytokines, mechanical stress) with aging-related signaling (senescence, mTOR activation), providing a mechanistic explanation for the age dependence and chronicity of IPF. Importantly, while IL-11 inhibition may remodel fibrotic signaling, **irreversible architectural scarring in advanced human IPF is unlikely to be fully reversed**, and therapeutic benefit is best framed as **slowing or halting disease progression**.

### (A2) Integrated List of Reported IL-11 Interactors
**Primary signaling components**
- **IL-11Rα**, **gp130** (classic signaling).
- **Soluble IL-11Rα (sIL-11Rα)** generated by **ADAM10/17-mediated shedding**, enabling trans-signaling.

**Upstream inducers/regulators**
- **TGF-β1:** dominant transcriptional inducer of IL-11 in fibroblasts; includes epigenetic derepression of the IL11 locus.
- **Inflammatory cytokines:** IL‑1β, TNF‑α, IL‑17A, IL‑22.
- **Mechanical stress pathways:** matrix stiffness and stretch induce IL‑11/IL‑11Rα expression.
- **Collectin‑11 (CL‑11):** activates ERK/AKT–mTOR/STAT3/SMAD2 signaling and induces IL‑11 expression, positioning it as an upstream amplifier.

**Downstream effectors**
- **ERK → p90RSK → GSK3β inhibition → SNAI1 stabilization** (myofibroblast differentiation, EMT-like programs).
- **JAK2/STAT3** (inflammation, survival, senescence reinforcement).
- **mTORC1** (selective translation of collagen and ECM proteins).
- **WNT5B** (cytoskeletal remodeling under mechanical stress).

### (A3) Protein Interaction Network and Fibrosis/Aging Pathway Modeling
**Modeling framework (data-integrative, constraint-aware)**
- **Network construction:** Nodes include IL‑11, IL‑11Rα, gp130, ERK, STAT3, mTORC1, TGF‑β/SMAD2/3, CL‑11, ADAM10/17, and inflammatory cytokines. Edges represent curated physical interactions (ligand–receptor binding, receptor complex assembly), signaling dependencies (kinase activation), and regulatory relationships (induction, shedding).
- **Topology rationale:** Even without presenting explicit numerical metrics, the network is structured such that:
  - **IL‑11 occupies a proximal position downstream of multiple independent inducers** (TGF‑β, CL‑11, inflammation, mechanical stress), giving it high *effective degree*.
  - IL‑11 lies **upstream of multiple partially redundant effector arms** (ERK, STAT3, mTORC1), conferring high *pathway betweenness* relative to single downstream kinases.
  - Downstream nodes (ERK, STAT3) have higher absolute connectivity but lower disease specificity due to extensive participation in non-fibrotic networks.
- **Pathway convergence:** ERK–mTORC1 and JAK2/STAT3 overlap with hallmarks of aging and senescence, creating positive feedback loops with SASP factors and TGF‑β.
- **Interpretive limitation:** This analysis is **conceptual and topology-informed rather than quantitatively parameterized**; therefore, conclusions are comparative and mechanistic, not mathematically optimized. Tissue context and cell-type specificity remain critical constraints.

### (A4) Final Target Candidates and Rationale
**Primary target (highest priority)**
1. **IL-11 (ligand neutralization)**  
   - *Rationale:* Intercepts multiple upstream fibrotic and aging-related inputs simultaneously; blocks classic signaling and prevents formation of new trans-signaling complexes; offers greater disease specificity than global TGF‑β or ERK inhibition. Expected benefit is **attenuation of progression rather than guaranteed reversal** of established human fibrosis.

**Secondary/alternative targets**
2. **IL-11Rα (receptor blockade)**  
   - *Rationale:* Prevents signaling complex assembly but may be less effective if pre-formed IL‑11/sIL‑11Rα complexes dominate.
3. **ERK pathway (downstream modulation)**  
   - *Rationale:* Central effector of fibrotic translation; limited by pleiotropy and toxicity.
4. **STAT3 (selective axis modulation)**  
   - *Rationale:* Key for inflammation/senescence; systemic inhibition poses risk.
5. **ADAM10/17 (shedding modulation)**  
   - *Rationale:* Reduces trans-signaling; broad physiological roles limit standalone use.
6. **CL‑11 (upstream modulation, adjunctive)**  
   - *Rationale:* Acts as an amplifier of IL‑11 induction; inhibition alone may not fully suppress fibrosis but could complement IL‑11 blockade in specific endotypes.

**Conclusion:** **IL‑11 neutralization remains the most leverage-rich and disease-focused strategy**, with CL‑11 and receptor‑level approaches as rational adjuncts rather than replacements.

## (B) Binder Proposal to Effectively Inhibit IL-11 and Its Interactors (Biotherapeutic Design)

### (B1) Target Class and Modality
- **Primary modality:** **Human monoclonal antibody (mAb)** targeting IL‑11.
- **Alternative/complementary modalities:** Anti–IL‑11Rα mAb; **engineered IL‑11 traps** (IL‑11Rα–gp130 ectodomain fusions); **nanobody–Fc constructs**; stabilized peptides with half-life extension.

### (B2) Binder Design Strategy (High-Level)
1. **Epitope selection**
   - Primary focus on **IL‑11 Site‑I (IL‑11:IL‑11Rα interface)** to prevent new signaling complex formation.
   - **Contingency consideration:** If pre‑formed IL‑11/sIL‑11Rα complexes are prevalent, a **ligand-sequestering trap** or **dual‑epitope antibody** (blocking receptor binding and gp130 engagement) may be required.
2. **Structural guidance**
   - Exploit IL‑11 conformational flexibility (AB loop, site‑II/III orientation) to stabilize non‑productive states.
3. **Affinity/specificity goals**
   - Sub‑nanomolar affinity for IL‑11 with strong discrimination from IL‑6 family cytokines.
4. **Engineering**
   - Human IgG with FcRn‑enhancing mutations for extended dosing intervals; Fc effector functions minimized to reduce off‑target inflammation.
5. **Functional validation**
   - Suppression of IL‑11–driven **pERK** and **pSTAT3** in lung fibroblasts; inhibition of ECM protein synthesis; assessment of both classic and trans‑signaling contexts.
6. **Adjunct strategies**
   - Combination with upstream modulators (e.g., CL‑11 axis) or antifibrotic standard of care to maximize pathway suppression without increasing toxicity.

**Assumptions and limitations**
- The quantitative contribution of trans‑signaling in IPF remains uncertain; binder modality choice should remain flexible based on pharmacodynamic readouts.

### (B3) Hypotheses on Efficacy and Safety
- **Efficacy:** IL‑11 inhibition is expected to **slow or halt fibrotic progression**, reduce fibroblast activation, ECM accumulation, inflammation, and senescence signaling via ERK/STAT3/mTORC1 attenuation. Reversal of advanced human fibrosis is not assumed.
- **On‑target safety risks:** Given IL‑11’s known role in thrombopoiesis (historical clinical use of recombinant IL‑11), **thrombocytopenia represents a mechanism‑based risk**.
  - *Mitigation strategies:* dose titration to partial pathway suppression, avoidance of complete systemic blockade, extended‑interval dosing, and early platelet count–guided adjustments.
- **Additional monitoring:** bone metabolism, wound healing, and infection risk, particularly in elderly IPF populations.
- **Biomarkers:** circulating IL‑11 and sIL‑11Rα for patient stratification; pERK/pSTAT3 and ECM markers for pharmacodynamic assessment.

**Overall Strategy Summary:**  
A network‑informed, mechanism‑focused analysis identifies **IL‑11 as a central convergence node linking fibrosis and aging pathways** in pulmonary fibrosis. While quantitative network metrics are not explicitly modeled, pathway topology and biological specificity support IL‑11 as the most strategic intervention point. **Carefully engineered IL‑11–neutralizing biologics**, with contingency plans for trans‑signaling and proactive safety mitigation, offer a rational approach to disease‑modifying therapy aimed at **arresting progression** rather than overstating reversal of human IPF.
