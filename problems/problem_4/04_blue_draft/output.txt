## (A) Analysis of IL-11 and IL-11 Interacting Factors Driving Pulmonary Fibrosis

### (A1) Role of IL-11 in Pulmonary Fibrosis and Aging
- **Pulmonary fibrosis (IPF):** IL-11 is strongly upregulated in IPF lungs and is required for fibroblast-to-myofibroblast differentiation, ECM protein synthesis, and fibrotic remodeling. Genetic deletion of **IL11RA** or pharmacologic IL-11 neutralization protects against and can reverse bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis in preclinical models.
- **Signaling characteristics:** IL-11 signals via a **hexameric IL-11/IL-11Rα/gp130 complex**, activating **ERK (dominant, sustained, post-transcriptional effects)** and **JAK2/STAT3** (pro-inflammatory and pro-survival transcription).
- **Aging/senescence:** IL-11 is a **core SASP factor**, increases with age across tissues, and drives ERK–mTORC1 activation and STAT3 signaling, reinforcing senescence and metabolic dysfunction. IL-11 blockade reduces senescence markers (p16, p21) and improves healthspan/lifespan in mice.
- **Fibrosis–aging coupling:** IL-11 integrates TGF-β, inflammatory cytokines, mechanical stress, and senescence signals, explaining age-dependence and chronicity of IPF.

### (A2) Integrated List of Newly Reported IL-11 Interactors
**Primary signaling components**
- **IL-11Rα**, **gp130** (classic signaling); **soluble IL-11Rα** (trans-signaling via ADAM10/17-mediated shedding).

**Upstream inducers/regulators**
- **TGF-β1** (dominant inducer; includes DNMT downregulation and IL11 promoter demethylation).
- **Inflammatory cytokines:** IL-1β, TNFα, IL-17A, IL-22.
- **Mechanical stress pathways:** stretch-induced IL-11/IL-11Rα upregulation.
- **Collectin-11 (CL-11):** induces IL-11 via ERK/AKT–mTOR/STAT3/SMAD2.

**Downstream effectors**
- **ERK → p90RSK → GSK3β (inhibition) → SNAI1 stabilization** (myofibroblast differentiation/EMT).
- **JAK2/STAT3** (inflammation, senescence reinforcement).
- **mTORC1** (selective translation of ECM proteins; aging linkage).
- **WNT5B** (cytoskeletal remodeling under mechanical stress).

### (A3) Protein Interaction Network and Fibrosis/Aging Pathway Modeling
**Modeling approach (conceptual)**
- **Nodes:** IL-11, IL-11Rα, gp130, ERK, STAT3, mTORC1, TGF-β/SMAD2/3, inflammatory cytokines, CL-11, ADAM10.
- **Edges:** ligand–receptor binding; kinase activation; transcriptional/post-transcriptional regulation; receptor shedding.
- **Network properties:** IL-11 exhibits **high degree and betweenness centrality**, acting as a convergence hub for diverse profibrotic inputs and a distributor to ERK/STAT3/mTORC1 outputs.
- **Pathway convergence:** ERK–mTORC1 and JAK2/STAT3 overlap with aging hallmarks; positive feedback with TGF-β and SASP sustains chronic fibrosis.
- **Caveat:** Context-dependent IL-11 effects (e.g., regenerative roles in specific endothelial settings) necessitate tissue-aware interpretation.

### (A4) Final Target Candidates and Rationale
**Primary target (highest priority)**
1. **IL-11 (ligand neutralization)**  
   - *Rationale:* Maximal disruption of convergent profibrotic signaling; blocks both classic and trans-signaling; superior specificity vs upstream TGF-β inhibition; demonstrated reversal of fibrosis and anti-aging benefits preclinically.

**Secondary/alternative targets**
2. **IL-11Rα (receptor blockade)**  
   - *Rationale:* Prevents complex assembly; effective but may not neutralize all ligand pools if trans-signaling predominates.
3. **ERK pathway (downstream modulation)**  
   - *Rationale:* Clinically validated antifibrotic relevance; less specific due to pleiotropy.
4. **STAT3 (selective IL-11–driven axis)**  
   - *Rationale:* Central to inflammation/senescence; toxicity risk with broad inhibition.
5. **ADAM10 (shedding modulation)**  
   - *Rationale:* Limits trans-signaling; physiological breadth limits standalone use.

**Conclusion:** **Direct IL-11 neutralization** is the optimal, high-leverage strategy.

## (B) Binder Proposal to Effectively Inhibit IL-11 and Its Interactors (Biotherapeutic Design)

### (B1) Target Class and Modality
- **Primary modality:** **Human monoclonal antibody (mAb)** against IL-11.
- **Alternative/complementary modalities:** Anti–IL-11Rα mAb; **nanobodies** (Fc-fused); **engineered receptor traps** (IL-11Rα–gp130 ectodomain fusion); **cyclic peptides** (with half-life extension).

### (B2) Binder Design Strategy (High-Level)
1. **Epitope selection**
   - Target **IL-11 site-I (IL-11Rα-binding interface)** to prevent initial complex formation, blocking both classic and trans-signaling.
2. **Structural guidance**
   - Leverage known IL-11 conformational dynamics (AB loop; site-II/III gp130 interfaces) to enforce non-productive conformations.
3. **Affinity/specificity goals**
   - **KD < 1 nM** for human IL-11; **>1000-fold selectivity vs IL-6** and other gp130 cytokines.
4. **Engineering**
   - Human IgG1 with **FcRn-enhancing mutations** (e.g., YTE) for extended half-life.
5. **Validation readouts**
   - Inhibition of **pERK** and **pSTAT3** in fibroblasts; suppression of ECM protein synthesis (post-transcriptional); blockade of sIL-11Rα–mediated signaling.
6. **Alternatives**
   - Nanobody–Fc for tissue penetration; receptor traps for high-avidity sequestration; peptides with PEGylation/albumin-binding for stability.

**Assumptions/limitations**
- Trans-signaling contribution in IPF is incompletely quantified; site-I targeting mitigates this uncertainty.
- Structural selectivity must be empirically confirmed to avoid IL-6 pathway interference.

### (B3) Hypotheses on Efficacy and Safety
- **Efficacy:** IL-11 neutralization will suppress fibroblast activation, ECM accumulation, inflammation, EMT, and senescence via ERK/STAT3/mTORC1 inhibition; expected to **halt and potentially reverse fibrosis** and provide **anti-aging benefits**.
- **Safety:** Anticipated acceptable profile based on preclinical longevity studies; monitor **platelets** (thrombopoiesis), **bone density**, and **wound healing**. Site-I targeting minimizes off-target gp130 cytokine effects.
- **Biomarkers:** Baseline serum IL-11 for enrichment; pharmacodynamics via pERK/pSTAT3 and circulating ECM markers.

**Overall Strategy Summary:**  
Integrative network analysis identifies **IL-11 as the central hub** linking fibrosis and aging. **Site-I–targeting anti–IL-11 mAbs** provide the most specific, potent, and mechanistically grounded intervention, with complementary modalities as backups and combination options for maximal clinical impact.
