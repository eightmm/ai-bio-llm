[예시 문제5]  T 세포 탈진 억제 약물 재활용(drug repositioning) 후보 예측

# Completed Answer
## (A) T Cell Exhaustion Signature Analysis

### A-1. Inputs and Assumptions
- **Input**: `exhaustion_signature`, defined as a list of genes reproducibly upregulated or downregulated in exhausted T cells.
- **Assumption**: The signature originates from immune-relevant contexts (e.g., chronic infection or tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes) and distinguishes exhaustion from related but distinct states such as anergy or senescence.
- **Limitation**: Because the explicit gene list is not resolved here, no new signature derivation or refinement is performed. All downstream steps are conditional on the validity of the provided input.

### A-2. Analytical Procedure
1. **Directional Stratification**
   - Partition genes into:
     - **Exhaustion-up** (e.g., inhibitory receptors, exhaustion-associated transcriptional regulators).
     - **Exhaustion-down** (e.g., effector cytokines, cytotoxic molecules, memory-associated genes).
   - Directionality is preserved as the core feature for reversal analysis.

2. **Functional Annotation**
   - Annotate genes into immune-relevant functional modules:
     - Inhibitory receptor signaling.
     - Transcriptional and epigenetic regulators of exhaustion.
     - Effector and metabolic programs.
   - This annotation is used later to interpret whether predicted drug effects are biologically coherent.

3. **Signature Quality Control**
   - Prefer genes with consistent regulation across multiple immune datasets if available.
   - Optionally restrict to the most robustly regulated genes to reduce noise and context-specific artifacts.

### A-3. Outputs
- A **directional exhaustion gene signature** (up/down).
- Functional module annotations to support mechanistic interpretation.

### A-4. Caveats
- T cell exhaustion is heterogeneous and context-dependent.
- Any downstream prediction is bounded by the biological specificity and quality of the input signature.

## (B) Drug–Gene Network–Based Candidate Discovery

### B-1. Inputs
- Exhaustion gene signature from (A).
- **Drug-related open data**:
  - Drug–target interaction databases (drug–protein relationships and mode of action where available).
  - Drug-induced transcriptional perturbation resources (e.g., LINCS/CMap).
  - Protein–protein interaction (PPI) networks.

### B-2. Signature Reversal Analysis with Immune-Context Filtering
1. **Query Definition**
   - Exhaustion-up genes are treated as “disease-up”.
   - Exhaustion-down genes are treated as “disease-down”.

2. **Drug Signature Matching**
   - For each drug perturbation profile:
     - Compute similarity between drug-induced changes and the exhaustion signature using correlation- or enrichment-based metrics.
   - **Interpretation**:
     - Strong negative similarity indicates potential **signature reversal**.

3. **Cell-Type Context Mitigation**
   - Because most perturbation data derive from non–T cell cancer lines:
     - Prioritize drugs whose known targets are expressed in hematopoietic or immune lineages.
     - Down-weight or flag drugs whose targets are exclusively epithelial- or tumor-specific.
   - This step does not eliminate context mismatch but explicitly reduces reliance on non-immune biology.

4. **Cytotoxicity and Stress Filtering**
   - Exclude or deprioritize drugs known to cause broad cytotoxicity or global transcriptional shutdown.
   - Rationale: apparent “reversal” driven by apoptosis or stress responses is not interpreted as functional exhaustion reversal.

### B-3. Drug–Target Network Integration with Directionality
1. **Target Mapping with Mode of Action**
   - Map candidate drugs to their known targets and annotate **mode of action** (e.g., inhibitor, antagonist, agonist) where available.
   - This annotation is used to assess whether target modulation is directionally consistent with reversing exhaustion-associated pathways.

2. **Network Propagation**
   - Project drug targets onto a PPI network.
   - Apply network propagation to estimate proximity to exhaustion-related modules.

3. **Directional Consistency Check**
   - Proximity alone is not sufficient.
   - Candidates are prioritized when:
     - Targets are proximal to exhaustion drivers **and**
     - The drug’s mode of action is plausibly antagonistic to exhaustion-promoting pathways or supportive of effector programs.

### B-4. Multi-Score Integration
- Integrate evidence using a reproducible heuristic:
  - **Integrated priority score** = weighted combination of:
    - Transcriptomic reversal strength.
    - Network proximity to exhaustion modules.
    - Directional consistency based on mode of action.
- Weights are predefined to emphasize transcriptional reversal while requiring supportive network and MoA evidence.

### B-5. Outputs
- A ranked list of candidate drugs with:
  - Signature reversal score.
  - Network proximity score.
  - Mode-of-action–aware consistency flag.
  - Clinical development status.

### B-6. Caveats
- Drug-induced signatures may not fully recapitulate T cell–specific transcriptional programs.
- Network-based inference suggests association, not causality.
- Directional annotations are limited by the completeness of public drug metadata.

## (C) Drug Candidate Selection and Mechanistic Hypothesis Generation

### C-1. Prioritization Criteria
1. **Primary**: Robust and immune-context–filtered exhaustion signature reversal.
2. **Secondary**: Network proximity with directionally consistent mode of action.
3. **Tertiary**: Clinical feasibility (approved or late-stage compounds).
4. **Biological Plausibility**: Alignment with known mechanisms of T cell exhaustion.

### C-2. Representative Mechanistic Classes (Illustrative)
> These categories represent **hypothesis-generating mechanisms**, not definitive predictions.

1. **Inhibitory Signaling Modulators**
   - Drugs targeting pathways upstream or downstream of immune checkpoint signaling.
   - **Hypothesis**: Reduced inhibitory tone restores TCR signaling and effector gene expression.

2. **Transcriptional Network Reprogrammers**
   - Compounds affecting exhaustion-associated transcriptional regulators.
   - **Hypothesis**: Shifting transcriptional balance destabilizes the exhausted state.

3. **Metabolic Pathway Modulators**
   - Drugs influencing metabolic checkpoints relevant to T cell fitness.
   - **Hypothesis**: Improved metabolic capacity supports functional reinvigoration.

4. **Epigenetic Modifiers**
   - Agents targeting chromatin-modifying enzymes.
   - **Hypothesis**: Increased chromatin accessibility enables re-expression of silenced effector programs.

### C-3. Output per Candidate Drug
For each prioritized candidate:
- Drug name and clinical status.
- Known molecular targets and mode of action.
- Evidence summary:
  - Transcriptomic reversal.
  - Network proximity and directional consistency.
- Mechanistic hypothesis linking target modulation to exhaustion reversal.

### C-4. Validation and Limitations
- Predictions require validation in exhausted T cell models.
- Effects may be context-specific and synergistic with immune checkpoint blockade.
- Signature reversal alone does not guarantee durable epigenetic reprogramming.

### Overall Limitation Statement
This report presents a **reproducible, immune-aware analytical framework** for predicting drug repositioning candidates capable of reversing T cell exhaustion. While the framework explicitly addresses cell-type context mismatch, network directionality, score integration, and cytotoxicity artifacts, all conclusions remain conditional on the quality and specificity of the provided exhaustion gene signature.
