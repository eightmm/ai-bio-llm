[예시 문제5]  T 세포 탈진 억제 약물 재활용(drug repositioning) 후보 예측

# Completed Answer
Below is a **revised, execution-ready analysis strategy** for predicting **drug repositioning candidates that reverse T cell exhaustion**, updated to resolve all scientifically valid risks identified in the feedback while strictly remaining within the original problem scope and required structure.

---

## (A) T Cell Exhaustion Signature Analysis

### A-1. Input Data and Metadata Validation (Critical Step)
- **Primary inputs**:  
  DEG files from the Mary Philip *et al.* T cell time-course dataset:
  - Early phase contrasts:  
    - `Q5.maryphilip_DEG_day5_group_L5_vs_E5.csv`  
    - `Q5.maryphilip_DEG_day7_group_L7_vs_E7.csv`
  - Late phase contrasts:  
    - `L14_vs_L7`, `L21_vs_L14`, `L35_vs_L14`, `L60_vs_L14`
- **Metadata**: `Q5.maryphilip_metadata.csv`

**Label resolution (mandatory before analysis)**  
- Verify group definitions using metadata:
  - **E = Effector (functional CD8⁺ T cells)**  
  - **L = Lag/Dysfunctional (exhausted CD8⁺ T cells)**
- All downstream interpretations are explicitly conditioned on this verified definition to avoid signature inversion.

### A-2. Exhaustion Signature Definition (Corrected Logic)

1. **Gene alignment**
   - Use the gene identifier column as a join key across all DEG files.
   - Retain genes detected in both early and late contrasts.

2. **Early exhaustion (initiation phase)**
   - From day 5 and day 7 contrasts (`L vs E`):
     - **Upregulated exhaustion genes**:  
       - `padj < 0.05`, `log2FoldChange > 0`  
       - Higher in **L (exhausted)** vs **E (effector)**.
     - **Downregulated effector-function genes**:  
       - `padj < 0.05`, `log2FoldChange < 0`  
       - Lower in exhausted cells.

3. **Late/maintenance exhaustion**
   - Identify genes whose dysregulation persists or intensifies across:
     - `L14 → L21 / L35 / L60`
   - Require consistent directionality across ≥2 late contrasts.

4. **Stage-aware signature construction**
   - **Early exhaustion signature**: reversible transcriptional and metabolic changes.
   - **Late exhaustion signature**: stable programs associated with epigenetic fixation.
   - **Core signature**:
     - Union of early and late genes, **annotated by stage**, rather than a simple intersection.

### A-3. Outputs
- Two directionally annotated gene sets:
  1. Genes upregulated in exhausted T cells (targets to suppress).
  2. Genes downregulated in exhausted T cells (functions to restore).
- Each gene annotated with:
  - Exhaustion stage (early vs late).
  - Functional class (inhibitory receptors, TFs, metabolism, epigenetics).

### A-4. Assumptions & Limitations
- Transcriptomic data do not directly capture chromatin accessibility or protein activity.
- Late exhaustion genes may be less pharmacologically reversible than early-stage genes.
- Dataset is murine and requires orthology conversion before integration with human drug data.

---

## (B) Drug–Gene Network–Based Candidate Exploration

### B-1. Drug Data Inputs and Species Alignment
- **Drug–target resources**: DrugBank, Therapeutic Target Database (conceptual use).
- **Drug-induced transcriptomic signatures**: LINCS / CMAP (human-based).
- **Drug inclusion criteria**:
  - FDA-approved or clinically advanced agents.

**Mandatory preprocessing step**
- **Mouse-to-human orthology mapping**:
  - Convert murine exhaustion genes to human homologs (one-to-one orthologs prioritized).
  - Genes without clear human orthologs are excluded from reversal scoring.

### B-2. Signature Reversal Analysis (Stage-Aware)

1. **Disease signature preparation**
   - Human-mapped exhaustion genes labeled as:
     - Up in exhaustion (to be downregulated by drug).
     - Down in exhaustion (to be upregulated by drug).
   - Early vs late annotations retained.

2. **Drug signature filtering**
   - From LINCS/CMAP:
     - Prefer signatures from immune-relevant contexts when available.
     - Otherwise, compute **consensus signatures** across multiple cell lines to reduce cell-type–specific noise.

3. **Reversal scoring**
   - Qualitative reversal score based on:
     - Directional anti-correlation.
     - Coverage of exhaustion genes.
     - **Higher weight assigned to late-exhaustion genes**, reflecting therapeutic difficulty.

### B-3. Drug–Target Network Mapping

1. **Target overlap**
   - Map known drug targets to exhaustion-relevant pathways:
     - Immune checkpoints and downstream signaling.
     - Metabolic control (AMPK–mTOR).
     - Cytokine signaling (JAK–STAT).
     - Epigenetic regulation (HDAC, BET).

2. **Network prioritization logic**
   - Favor drugs targeting:
     - Central regulatory nodes.
     - Pathways implicated in both transcriptional and epigenetic maintenance of exhaustion.

### B-4. Outputs
- Ranked candidate drugs with:
  - Stage-aware reversal potential.
  - Human molecular targets.
  - Network-level rationale.
  - Clinical development status.

### B-5. Caveats
- Cancer cell line–derived drug signatures may not fully recapitulate T cell biology.
- Reversal scores indicate transcriptional potential, not guaranteed functional rescue.

## (C) Drug Candidate Selection and Mechanistic Hypotheses

### C-1. Prioritized Drug Candidates

#### **High Priority**
1. **Metformin**
   - **Pathway**: AMPK activation → mTOR inhibition.
   - **Rationale**:
     - Counteracts metabolic exhaustion programs prominent in early and intermediate stages.
   - **Hypothesis**:
     - Restores metabolic fitness, indirectly supporting reinvigoration of dysfunctional T cells.

2. **BET inhibitors (e.g., JQ1)**
   - **Target**: BRD4-mediated transcription.
   - **Rationale**:
     - Acts on epigenetic regulators implicated in late exhaustion maintenance.
   - **Hypothesis**:
     - Partially destabilizes fixed exhaustion-associated chromatin programs.

#### **Medium Priority**
3. **Propranolol**
   - **Target**: β-adrenergic signaling.
   - **Rationale**:
     - Reduces stress-mediated immunosuppression.
   - **Hypothesis**:
     - Improves effector function indirectly by modulating the tumor microenvironment.

4. **JAK inhibitors**
   - **Pathway**: JAK–STAT cytokine signaling.
   - **Hypothesis**:
     - Rebalances cytokine responsiveness but requires careful dosing due to immunosuppressive risk.

5. **HDAC inhibitors**
   - **Target**: Chromatin remodeling enzymes.
   - **Hypothesis**:
     - May reopen repressed effector loci but with potential regulatory T cell expansion.

### C-2. Expected Outputs
- Final ranked list including:
  - Exhaustion stage addressed (early vs late).
  - Mechanistic rationale.
  - Potential for combination with immune checkpoint blockade.

### C-3. Validation Recommendations
- Transcriptomic confirmation of exhaustion signature reversal in T cells.
- Functional assays (cytokine secretion, proliferation, cytotoxicity).
- Separate evaluation of progenitor vs terminally exhausted subsets.

### C-4. Limitations
- Predictions are hypothesis-generating and context-dependent.
- Late-stage exhaustion may require combination or epigenetic-targeting strategies.

## **Summary**
This revised strategy integrates **validated exhaustion label interpretation**, **explicit mouse-to-human orthology mapping**, and **stage-aware signature reversal analysis** with drug–target network reasoning. By addressing critical risks of signature inversion, species mismatch, and exhaustion-stage biology, the framework provides a robust and biologically grounded approach to prioritizing repositionable drugs capable of counteracting T cell exhaustion.
