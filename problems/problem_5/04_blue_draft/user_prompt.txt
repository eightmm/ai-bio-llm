# Integrated Strategy for Predicting T Cell Exhaustion-Reversing Drug Candidates Through Signature Reversal and Network-Based Drug–Gene Analysis

T cell exhaustion represents a critical barrier to effective cancer immunotherapy and chronic viral infection control, characterized by loss of effector functions, sustained expression of inhibitory receptors, and distinct transcriptomic and epigenetic profiles that render the exhausted state largely irreversible under standard conditions[1][4][14]. The phenomenon of T cell exhaustion poses one of the major hurdles to antiviral and antitumor immunity, particularly when immune checkpoint inhibitor monotherapy fails to achieve durable responses[14]. This comprehensive report describes an integrated computational and biological strategy for predicting drug repositioning candidates that can reverse the T cell exhaustion phenotype by leveraging exhaustion gene signatures, drug-induced transcriptional perturbation databases, drug-target interaction networks, and pathway analysis methods. The approach systematically combines signature reversal techniques with network pharmacology to identify drugs with high probability of restoring T cell function while providing mechanistic justification for their selection.

## Characterization of T Cell Exhaustion Gene Signatures and Molecular Programs

Exhausted CD8+ T cells display a distinctive transcriptional landscape that differs fundamentally from effector and memory T cells, establishing what researchers term an "epigenetic locking" phenomenon that contributes to phenotype stability[17]. The first critical step in any drug repurposing strategy targeting T cell exhaustion is comprehensive characterization of the exhaustion gene signature, which requires separation of upregulated and downregulated genes that define the exhausted state and their functional organization into molecular programs.

The exhaustion signature is fundamentally organized around the expression of inhibitory receptors and their associated transcriptional programs. High expression of immune checkpoint molecules including programmed cell death receptor-1 (PD-1 encoded by PDCD1), lymphocyte activation gene-3 (LAG-3), T cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains (TIGIT), and T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 3 (TIM-3 encoded by HAVCR2) characterizes exhausted T cells[4][11][40]. Beyond checkpoint receptor expression, exhausted T cells also express CD39 (ENTPD1) and CD103 (ITGAE), along with the transcription factor TOX and members of the NR4A family of nuclear receptors that actively orchestrate and maintain the exhausted phenotype[1][11][44][47]. The upregulation of these genes reflects active engagement with tumor-associated antigens, as exhausted T cells paradoxically retain evidence of tumor reactivity and even proliferation markers such as Ki-67 (MKI67), despite their functional impairment[4][40].

The downregulated genes in the exhaustion signature include core effector molecules critical for T cell function. Expression of granzyme B (GZMB), granulysin (GNLY), and Fas ligand (FASL), which encode the main effectors of T cell-mediated cytotoxicity, is markedly reduced or altered in exhausted T cells[4]. Similarly, genes encoding the T helper 1 (Th1) cytokines, particularly interferon-gamma (IFNG) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), show decreased expression[4][5][11]. Importantly, the transcription factor TCF7, which encodes a factor positively associated with favorable response to checkpoint therapy and enriched in non-exhausted cells, is substantially downregulated in exhausted T cells compared to less exhausted populations[4].

Functional enrichment and pathway analysis reveals that genes comprising the exhaustion signature cluster into several interconnected biological processes. The exhaustion signature is enriched in pathways related to ferroptosis, PD-L1 expression and PD-1 checkpoint signaling in cancer, and T helper cell differentiation[1]. Beyond these canonical immune checkpoint pathways, the signature encompasses metabolic insufficiency, reflecting altered glucose and lipid metabolism that characterizes exhausted T cells and contrasts sharply with the metabolic flexibility of effector cells[14]. Epigenetic regulation emerges as a central feature, with DNA methylation and histone modifications establishing stable repressive chromatin landscapes that suppress effector gene programs while maintaining expression of exhaustion-promoting factors[17]. These epigenetic changes, including decreased chromatin accessibility of regions enriched for AP-1 and bZIP transcription factor motifs, represent critical mechanisms through which T cell exhaustion becomes self-sustaining and resistant to reversal[19].

The transcriptional regulation of exhaustion involves a hierarchical network of transcription factors that integrate both positive and negative signals. The high-mobility group box transcription factors TOX and TOX2, along with members of the NR4A family including NR4A1, NR4A2, and NR4A3, are critical downstream targets of the calcium-calcineurin-regulated transcription factor NFAT[44][47]. In the absence of AP-1 (Fos-Jun) co-stimulation, NFAT alone activates this exhaustion transcriptional program, suggesting that the balance between activating and inhibitory transcriptional inputs fundamentally determines T cell fate[19][44][47]. TOX and NR4A transcription factors are therefore positioned as master regulators that impose the exhaustion phenotype through coordinated regulation of inhibitory receptor genes, metabolic reprogramming, and suppression of effector functions[47].

## Integration of Drug-Gene and Drug-Target Network Information

The second major component of the integrated drug repositioning strategy involves systematic integration of drug-target interaction information with drug-induced transcriptional perturbation data to construct a comprehensive network representing how drug-induced molecular changes relate to the exhaustion signature. This integration occurs at multiple levels: direct drug-target interactions, target-protein interactions mediated by protein-protein interaction networks, and drug-induced transcriptional changes captured in perturbation databases.

Drug-target information is retrieved from established biomedical databases that catalog pharmacological interactions. DrugBank serves as a primary resource, containing detailed information on over 7,800 drug entries including chemical, pharmacological, and pharmaceutical data, with comprehensive drug-target information at the sequence, structure, and pathway levels[15][18]. The Therapeutic Target Database (TTD) provides complementary target-centric information, containing data on 426 successful, 1,014 clinical trial, 212 preclinical/patented, and 1,479 literature-reported targets, with particular emphasis on target druggability characteristics from multiple perspectives including molecular interaction, human system profile, and cell-based expression variations[28]. PharmGKB provides additional context including genetic, genomic, and molecular phenotype data relevant to pharmacogenomics, containing searchable information on over 20,000 genes, 3,000 diseases, and 2,500 drugs[15]. These databases enable construction of the basic drug-target bipartite network where edges represent known pharmacological interactions.

Beyond direct targets, protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks expand the representation of drug effects by capturing how direct targets interact with other proteins and thereby influence broader cellular networks. The STRING database, incorporating information from 12,535 organisms with over 59.3 million proteins and 20 billion interactions[12], provides high-confidence functional protein associations that can be integrated with drug-target information to define expanded drug-target neighborhoods. Network propagation algorithms, particularly those based on random walk with restart (RWR) techniques, quantify how drug-target perturbations propagate through protein networks[7][10][31]. These propagation methods simulate the effect of drug-target interactions throughout the cell by computing a probability distribution that represents the likelihood that each gene will be perturbed as a consequence of direct and indirect interactions with drug targets[7][10][31].

Drug-induced transcriptional perturbation data provides direct evidence of how drugs actually alter cellular gene expression states. The Connectivity Map (CMap) represents the pioneering resource in this domain, initially developed to identify relationships between disease gene expression signatures and drug-induced signatures[24][32]. The L1000 platform, representing the next generation of CMap, measures 1,000 landmark transcripts that enable recovery of approximately 82% of transcriptome information while dramatically reducing measurement costs and computational requirements[32]. The Integrative Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures (iLINCS) extends this approach by aggregating transcriptional signatures from multiple databases including the LINCS L1000 assay, original CMap signatures, and other perturbational databases, creating a comprehensive resource for signature analysis[21][38]. These databases contain 200,000 or more chemical and genetic perturbation signatures measured across diverse cell types, enabling researchers to screen for drugs whose transcriptional effects are most inverse from disease signatures[3][6][32].

The integration of these multiple layers of information creates a comprehensive knowledge graph representing drug effects at multiple levels. At the most direct level, drug-induced transcriptional changes can be compared to the exhaustion signature using similarity metrics such as Pearson correlation coefficients, Spearman rank correlation, or specialized enrichment-based metrics like the connectivity score developed for CMap analyses[32][35]. The connectivity score provides three complementary measures of confidence: a nominal p-value comparing signature similarity to a null distribution using Kolmogorov-Smirnov enrichment statistics, a false discovery rate adjusted for multiple hypothesis testing, and a Tau value that contextualizes the observed enrichment score relative to all other scores in the database[32]. These statistical frameworks enable quantitative ranking of drugs by their capacity to reverse the exhaustion signature at the transcriptional level.

## Signature Reversal Framework and Quantification of Drug-Exhaustion Signature Antagonism

The signature reversal approach represents the core computational methodology for identifying drugs capable of counteracting the T cell exhaustion phenotype. This approach rests on the hypothesis that a drug producing transcriptional changes that are most inversely correlated with the disease gene expression signature would effectively reverse that disease state and thus serve as a promising therapeutic candidate[3][38][41].

The signature reversal framework operates through a series of well-defined computational steps. First, the exhaustion signature is represented as a ranked list of genes, typically ordered by their log-fold-change values in exhausted versus non-exhausted T cells, derived from differential expression analysis of transcriptomic datasets[3][27][38]. This ranking captures the magnitude and direction of gene expression changes characterizing the exhaustion phenotype. Second, drug-induced transcriptional signatures are similarly represented as ranked lists of genes reflecting the magnitude and direction of expression changes induced by drug treatment in cell culture experiments[32]. Third, two signatures are compared using similarity metrics that quantify the degree to which gene expression changes induced by the drug are opposite to changes observed in the exhaustion state[3][6][38].

The specific similarity metrics employed in signature reversal analysis include several complementary approaches. Pearson's correlation coefficient between the ranked gene expression vectors provides a straightforward measure of linear relationship, with negative correlation values indicating inverse signatures[3][38]. The Spearman rank correlation offers a nonparametric alternative that is robust to outliers and nonlinear relationships[6]. Kolmogorov-Smirnov enrichment statistics, as implemented in CMap-based analyses, compute whether genes that are upregulated in one signature are systematically shifted toward downregulation in the other, providing a more biologically focused assessment[32]. The connectivity score framework combines multiple complementary metrics to provide holistic quantification of reversal potential[32].

Critical to successful signature reversal analysis is appropriate selection of the gene set used for comparison. The entire transcriptome can be used for analysis, but in practice, studies often employ the top differentially expressed genes (for example, the 500 most up- and down-regulated genes) to focus the analysis on the most reliable and biologically meaningful changes while reducing noise[3][38][41]. The iLINCS platform implements flexible approaches allowing users to specify gene set size and composition, making it possible to assess how different gene selections influence results[21][38]. Importantly, when using landmark-based platforms like the L1000 assay, inference algorithms must be applied to predict expression values for non-landmark genes, with validation indicating that L1000 achieves approximately 95% inference accuracy for most genes, though some genes in the 17% poorly-inferred category should be excluded from analysis[32].

The quantification of signature reversal strength involves ranking all available drugs by the magnitude of their reversal potential. The concordance score, calculated by platforms such as iLINCS, represents the Pearson correlation coefficient between the query signature and each drug perturbation signature[38]. A highly negative concordance score (for example, <-0.2 to -0.5 depending on stringency) indicates strong reversal potential[38]. False discovery rate control is essential given the large number of drugs tested, with FDR thresholds of 0.05 to 0.25 applied depending on the desired specificity[3]. These computational filters identify a prioritized subset of drug candidates whose transcriptional effects antagonize the exhaustion signature at the whole-transcriptome level.

Beyond direct transcriptional reversal, mechanistic insight can be gained by analyzing which specific genes are most substantially reversed by candidate drugs[3][38]. Examining whether drugs preferentially reverse the expression of exhaustion-defining genes (such as PD-1, LAG-3, TIGIT, TIM-3, TOX, and NR4A family members) compared to other genes in the signature provides evidence that the drug targets the core exhaustion mechanism. Similarly, assessing whether drugs upregulate downregulated effector genes (such as GZMA, GZMB, IFNG, TNF) and restore expression of transcription factors like TCF7 indicates functional restoration of T cell effector capacity. Gene set enrichment analysis applied to the drug-induced gene expression changes can reveal whether drugs preferentially affect the same biological pathways implicated in exhaustion reversal, providing an additional layer of mechanistic evidence[16].

## Network-Based Drug-Target Analysis and Proximity Scoring

Beyond signature reversal analysis based on transcriptional profiles, integration of drug-target interaction networks enables mechanistic interpretation and provides confidence that drug effects result from biologically relevant target engagement rather than off-target transcriptional changes. Network-based approaches employ several complementary strategies to assess the relationship between drug targets and exhaustion-associated genes and pathways.

The most direct network-based approach assesses whether known drug targets directly interact with genes or proteins in the exhaustion signature. This can be evaluated using protein-protein interaction networks, where direct targets of a drug are queried against the PPI network to identify their first-neighbor proteins[10][28][31]. For T cell exhaustion, this approach would assess whether drug targets directly bind or interact with PD-1, LAG-3, TIGIT, TIM-3, or other checkpoint proteins, or whether they interact with downstream signaling molecules like SHP1, SHP2, or NFAT that transduce checkpoint inhibitory signals[8][11]. While some drugs may have direct interactions with checkpoint molecules (as in the case of biologics designed to block checkpoint-ligand interactions), most small molecules identified through signature reversal will lack direct checkpoint interactions and instead affect exhaustion through indirect mechanisms.

Network propagation algorithms provide more sophisticated approaches to quantify drug-target proximity to exhaustion-related genes through multi-step interactions. The network propagation approach, particularly random walk with restart (RWR) algorithms, simulates how perturbations of drug targets spread through the protein network to influence other genes[7][10][31]. The core RWR algorithm maintains a probability distribution across all nodes (genes/proteins) in the network, iteratively updating this distribution such that probability spreads from seed nodes (drug targets) to their neighbors with probability α, while restarting from the seed nodes with probability 1-α[7][31]. The resulting steady-state probability distribution quantifies the degree to which each gene is expected to be affected by perturbation of the drug targets, providing a druggability score reflecting network proximity.

Heterogeneous networks that integrate multiple types of relationships provide richer representations than simple PPI networks. Drug-specific gene selection approaches incorporate not only direct targets but also "indirect targets"—genes whose expression is significantly altered by drug targets through multi-step propagation[7]. This heterogeneous network captures both direct and contextual biological interactions relevant to each drug, enabling quantification of complex gene-pathway relationships[7]. The inclusion of pathway information during network propagation, such as through reinforcement with gene set enrichment information, ensures that pathway-relevant genes are amplified in the ranking, producing more biologically meaningful results[7].

For T cell exhaustion specifically, network propagation analysis would assess whether drug targets propagate through known exhaustion-associated pathways. The ferroptosis pathway, PD-L1 expression and PD-1 checkpoint signaling, T helper cell differentiation pathways, and metabolic pathways implicated in exhaustion would be queried to assess whether drug targets have high network proximity to pathway components[1]. Similarly, network analysis would evaluate the distance between drug targets and transcription factors like BATF and IRF4, which represent promising targets for preventing or reversing exhaustion[19][22]. The IRF4 and BATF transcription factors cooperate to counter T cell exhaustion in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, and overexpression of BATF in CAR T cells markedly increased survival and expansion while decreasing expression of inhibitory receptors and the exhaustion-associated transcription factor TOX[19][22]. Drug targets upstream of or functioning in parallel to these transcription factors would therefore represent promising repositioning candidates.

Network druggability analysis further prioritizes drug candidates by assessing the suitability of their targets for modulation by small molecules. The target assessment using druggability characteristics involves multiple perspectives including molecular interaction/regulation (such as binding pocket properties), human system profiles (such as protein sequence similarity and pathway associations), and cell-based expression variations[28]. The presence of suitable binding pockets is crucial for a target's druggability, and comprehensive evaluation of multiple druggability characteristics is more helpful than assessment of single characteristics[28]. Targets with high node degrees in protein-protein interaction networks (indicating many protein partners) and high betweenness centrality (indicating positions critical for network communication) must be approached cautiously, as their modulation may produce widespread off-target cellular effects[28]. Conversely, targets with more selective interaction networks and tissue-restricted expression patterns are more likely to produce manageable toxicity profiles and thus more successful clinical development[28].

## Drug Prioritization Frameworks Integrating Multiple Evidence Layers

The identification of drug repositioning candidates requires systematic prioritization combining signature reversal scores, network analysis results, clinical development status, and druggability characteristics into a coherent ranking framework. Such prioritization frameworks typically employ multi-criteria decision-making approaches that weight different evidence types according to their reliability and relevance.

The fundamental prioritization challenge involves ranking drugs by multiple distinct metrics—signature reversal score, network proximity score, clinical development stage, druggability score—that may not be directly comparable due to different scales and distributions. Multi-criteria decision-making techniques, particularly the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method, provide systematic approaches to this challenge[50][53]. The TOPSIS method identifies ideal and anti-ideal solutions representing the most and least favorable values for each criterion, then ranks alternatives by their distance to the ideal solution[50][53]. When applied to drug repositioning, this approach would define ideal criteria as maximal signature reversal score, maximal network proximity to exhaustion-associated pathways, approved or clinical-stage development status (as opposed to literature-reported), and high druggability scores[50][53].

A representative multi-criteria prioritization framework would weight candidate drugs as follows. First, the signature reversal score represents the primary criterion, as it directly assesses whether a drug produces transcriptional changes antagonistic to the exhaustion phenotype. Drugs with highly negative connectivity scores (for example, below -0.3) that pass FDR control (FDR < 0.05 to 0.25) receive the highest scores. Second, network proximity scores from drug-target propagation algorithms contribute secondary evidence that drug targets functionally interact with exhaustion-related pathways. Drugs with high network propagation scores relative to exhaustion pathway genes and exhaustion-associated transcription factors receive increased priority. Third, the clinical development stage provides practical guidance for speed of translational development. FDA-approved drugs can potentially move immediately to investigational new drug applications for new indications, requiring 52-61 months from investigational new drug application to approval based on historical data, compared to 10-15 years for entirely novel compounds[20][26]. Investigational drugs in clinical trials represent intermediate candidates, while literature-reported targets without drug candidates require earlier-stage development[3].

Drug druggability characteristics further stratify candidate drugs. Compounds with evidence of previous clinical use in any indication provide assurance that acceptable toxicity profiles have been achieved, whereas compounds with only preclinical evidence carry higher uncertainty regarding safety[26]. For small molecule drugs, the presence of known crystal structures with bound inhibitors, prior biochemical validation of target binding, and published kinase selectivity profiles (for kinase inhibitors) provide confidence in target engagement[28]. Candidate drugs with multiple published studies demonstrating target-dependent effects in cell-based or animal models receive higher priority than drugs with single-source evidence[26][29].

The final prioritization ranking can be visualized through bubble plots or ranked tables showing the top 10-50 candidates, with bubble size representing signature reversal score magnitude, color representing network proximity percentile, and position on the x-axis representing clinical development stage[3][38]. Such visualizations enable stakeholders to quickly identify the most promising candidates while understanding the evidence basis for each ranking[3][38].

## Mechanistic Hypothesis Generation and Biological Interpretation

High-ranked drug candidates from the prioritization framework require mechanistic hypothesis generation to articulate plausible biological mechanisms through which drug treatment could reverse T cell exhaustion. These hypotheses integrate knowledge of target function with known mechanisms of exhaustion and proposed pathways toward exhaustion reversal.

The PD-1/PD-L1 axis represents the most well-characterized mechanism of T cell exhaustion, with structural and functional studies delineating how PD-1 engagement by PD-L1 on tumor cells leads to rapid termination of T cell receptor intracellular signaling and inhibition of T cell proliferation[8]. The mechanism operates through direct and indirect pathways: engaged PD-1 recruits the protein tyrosine phosphatases SHP1 and SHP2 to its tyrosine phosphorylated ITIM and ITSM motifs, enabling dephosphorylation and inactivation of ZAP70 and subsequent inhibition of PI3K phosphorylation, which ordinarily drives T cell proliferation and cytokine production[8]. Additionally, PD-1 signaling promotes sustained downmodulation and degradation of the T cell receptor complex itself through upregulation of E3-ubiquitin ligases CBL-B, c-CBL, and ITCH, which catalyze TCR internalization[8]. Drugs that could directly or indirectly block this PD-1 signaling cascade—either through inhibition of the phosphatases recruited to PD-1, upregulation of phosphatases that counteract PD-1 effects, or through other mechanisms preventing SHP recruitment—would provide mechanistic basis for exhaustion reversal.

The LAG-3 immune checkpoint represents a complementary axis to PD-1, with recent evidence revealing non-redundant roles for these receptors in exhaustion[11]. Whereas PD-1 signaling specifically reduces T cell receptor-induced proliferation, LAG-3 signaling distinctively diminishes the production of cytokines and killing of target cells[11]. LAG-3 signaling requires sustained expression of TOX, the exhaustion-promoting transcriptional regulator, and LAG-3 controls a functional switch of CD94/NK receptor pathways toward inhibitory rather than activating signaling[11]. Drugs that target the LAG-3/TOX/CD94 immunosurveillance axis would thereby restore both proliferative capacity and effector function in exhausted T cells[11].

The TOX/NR4A transcriptional regulatory network provides a major focal point for mechanistic hypotheses about exhaustion reversal. TOX and TOX2, as well as the NR4A family of nuclear receptors, are critical downstream targets of NFAT signaling that actively impose the CD8+ T cell exhaustion program[44][47]. TOX and NR4A transcription factors directly activate expression of inhibitory receptors (PD-1, LAG-3, TIGIT, TIM-3), suppress expression of effector genes (GZMB, IFNG, TNF), and promote expression of anergy-related genes[47]. Disruption of TOX or NR4A expression or activity through pharmaceutical or genetic approaches strongly rescues exhausted T cell phenotypes, with knockout CAR T cells lacking TOX, TOX2, and NR4A transcription factors showing increased cytokine expression, decreased expression of inhibitory receptors, and increased accessibility of regions enriched for NFκB and bZIP transcription factor motifs that drive effector functions[19][44][47]. Drugs that inhibit TOX, NR4A, or NFAT signaling—or drugs that promote expression of AP-1 proteins (like BATF and IRF4) that compete with NFAT for binding sites—would provide strong mechanistic basis for reversing exhaustion through epigenetic and transcriptional reprogramming[19][47].

Metabolic reprogramming represents another critical mechanistic axis for exhaustion reversal. Exhausted T cells exhibit metabolic insufficiency characterized by altered glucose uptake, lipid metabolism, and amino acid utilization relative to effector T cells[14]. This metabolic dysfunction contributes to reduced effector functions and sustained T cell suppression, and metabolic intervention has emerged as a promising strategy for immunotherapy enhancement[2]. The immunometabolic drug metformin exemplifies this approach—metformin activates AMPK to phosphorylate PD-L1 at serine 195, inducing abnormal glycosylation and PD-L1 degradation, thereby blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 axis through a fundamentally distinct mechanism from checkpoint blockade antibodies[2]. Additionally, metformin reshapes the tumor immune microenvironment by reducing myeloid-derived suppressor cell populations and increasing CD8+ T cell infiltration[2]. Drug candidates that target metabolic pathways—such as the mTOR pathway, glycolytic enzymes, fatty acid synthesis enzymes, or metabolic regulators like AMPK activators—provide compelling mechanistic hypotheses for exhaustion reversal through metabolic reprogramming[2][26].

Epigenetic regulation offers additional mechanistic leverage points. DNA methylation and histone modifications establishing stable repressive chromatin landscapes in exhausted T cells can theoretically be targeted through histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors or DNA methyltransferase inhibitors[17]. The combination of pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor) with vorinostat (HDAC inhibitor) in primary mediastinal B cell lymphoma achieved complete and overall response rates up to 80%, substantially superior to monotherapy, suggesting that epigenetic modulation can enhance checkpoint inhibitor efficacy[42]. Drugs identified through signature reversal that target epigenetic regulators would provide mechanistic justification based on this precedent[17][42].

The combination therapy context provides important mechanistic guidance for drug selection. Exhaustion resistance to single-agent checkpoint inhibitors frequently results from upregulation of alternative inhibitory receptors and compensatory immunosuppressive pathways[33][36][42]. Dual checkpoint inhibition (targeting both PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4) has shown superior efficacy to monotherapy in multiple cancer types[33][42]. Drug candidates that target distinct mechanistic axes from checkpoint blockade—such as metabolic regulators, targeted kinase inhibitors, HDAC inhibitors, or agents modulating myeloid cell populations—provide particularly strong mechanistic rationale when considered for combination with checkpoint inhibitors[33][42]. The signature reversal approach naturally identifies such complementary mechanisms by searching across diverse drugs for transcriptional antagonism to the exhaustion program[3][38].

## Implementation Strategy and Practical Workflow

A complete implementation of the integrated drug repositioning strategy requires execution of a series of computational and analytical steps that must be carefully executed to ensure robust results. This section describes the practical workflow for implementing the framework.

The workflow begins with curation and processing of the exhaustion gene signature. Transcriptomic data comparing exhausted T cells to non-exhausted controls should be obtained from published datasets, preferably including single-cell RNA sequencing studies that can precisely identify exhausted T cell populations and separate them from heterogeneous populations in tumor samples or chronically infected tissues[4][37][40]. Differential expression analysis using established packages (edgeR with trimmed mean of M-values normalization, DESeq2 with geometric mean normalization, or limma with empirical Bayes approaches) identifies genes with significant expression changes between conditions[27]. The resulting log-fold change values and associated p-values are used to create a ranked gene list ordered by effect size, providing the input for signature reversal analysis[3][27].

Pathway and transcription factor enrichment analysis should be performed on this initial gene list using multiple complementary methods. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) using preranked gene lists against biological pathway databases (KEGG, Reactome, Gene Ontology) identifies pathways enriched among upregulated and downregulated genes[13][16]. Transcription factor enrichment analysis using tools like X2K or TFs enrichment analysis identifies transcription factor binding motifs overrepresented in the promoter regions of exhaustion-associated genes, suggesting key transcriptional regulators[13][16]. These enrichment results provide biological validation of the gene signature and generate initial hypotheses about the core mechanisms of exhaustion.

The signature reversal analysis component leverages existing computational platforms. The iLINCS web platform provides an accessible interface for uploading a query gene expression signature and searching for drugs with concordance values indicating reversal[21][38]. Alternatively, researchers with bioinformatic expertise can utilize the signatureSearch R package or WebCMap to implement custom analyses with greater control over parameters such as gene set size, similarity metric choice, and FDR stringency[6][30]. The analysis queries the signature against multiple drug perturbation libraries including LINCS L1000 chemical perturbations, original CMap signatures, cancer therapeutics response signatures, and pharmacogenomics signatures, maximizing the breadth of drug coverage[21][38]. Results are exported as ranked lists of drugs with connectivity scores and p-values, which are filtered to identify candidates with strong reversal potential (typically p-value <0.05 or FDR <0.25, and connectivity score <-0.3)[3][38].

Parallel to signature reversal analysis, drug-target information is retrieved from established databases. The DrugBank API or web interface enables downloading drug-target interaction information for all drugs in the initial candidate list[18]. For each drug, the primary and secondary targets are extracted and cross-referenced against UniProtKB accession numbers to ensure consistency across databases. The STRING database can be queried with drug target lists to retrieve first-neighbor and second-neighbor proteins in the protein-protein interaction network[12]. Network propagation analysis using tools like HotNet2, NetGP, or custom RWR implementations then computes the extent to which perturbation of drug targets propagates through the network to influence genes in the exhaustion signature[7][10][31].

Pathway enrichment analysis should be applied to drug-induced transcriptional changes to generate mechanistic insight beyond simple reversal scoring. For leading drug candidates, the set of genes most substantially upregulated or downregulated by drug treatment should be subjected to pathway enrichment analysis using GSEA or other methods[16]. Results indicating enrichment for "immune activation," "T cell activation," "cytokine production," or "effector function" pathways provide support for mechanistic hypotheses that the drug restores T cell function. Conversely, enrichment for "immunosuppression," "anergy," or "cell cycle arrest" pathways would be concerning and warrant further investigation.

Drug prioritization using multi-criteria decision-making frameworks requires quantitative scoring of each candidate on multiple dimensions. A scoring rubric might assign points (0-10 scale) for signature reversal score based on percentile rank (top 5% = 10 points, top 10% = 8 points, etc.), points for network proximity percentile, points for clinical development stage (FDA-approved = 10 points, clinical trial = 7 points, preclinical = 3 points), and points for target druggability (based on TTD or similar assessments). These raw scores can be normalized to a 0-1 scale and combined with pre-specified weights reflecting the relative importance of each criterion. TOPSIS or similar multi-criteria methods then rank candidates by their overall composite scores[50][53].

The final mechanistic hypothesis generation step involves systematic literature review of each top-ranked drug's known targets and effects, combined with synthesis into a coherent model of how drug treatment could reverse T cell exhaustion. For each drug, a brief mechanistic summary should articulate: (1) the primary targets of the drug, (2) how these targets relate to known exhaustion mechanisms, (3) the supporting evidence from signature reversal and network analysis, (4) the precedent from existing literature suggesting checkpoint inhibitor enhancement, and (5) testable predictions about T cell phenotypic and functional changes expected upon drug treatment. This mechanistic framework provides rationale for recommending drugs for downstream experimental validation.

## Case Examples and Application to T Cell Exhaustion Candidates

To illustrate the practical application of this integrated framework, several exemplary drugs identified through signature reversal approaches warrant discussion. Drug repositioning studies have successfully identified candidates such as pentamidine, metformin, propranolol, and various targeted kinase inhibitors as potential enhancers of T cell function and checkpoint inhibitor efficacy.

Pentamidine, an antimicrobial agent originally approved for treating African trypanosomiasis, leishmaniasis, and pneumocystis pneumonia, exemplifies a successfully repositioned drug candidate[5]. Virtual docking analysis identified pentamidine as a potential small molecule that binds to PD-L1, and experimental validation confirmed that pentamidine blocks the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction and restores T cell activity through this mechanism[5]. Treatment of co-cultured primary human T cells and PD-L1-expressing tumor cells with pentamidine enhanced T cell-mediated cytotoxicity and increased secretion of IFN-γ, TNF-α, perforin, and granzyme B, with effects comparable to the approved checkpoint inhibitor atezolizumab[5]. This example demonstrates how a drug originally developed for infectious disease can be repositioned through identification of a novel mechanism (direct PD-L1 binding) that emerges from screening against disease-relevant signatures and targets.

Metformin, a widely used antidiabetic agent, represents another prominent repositioning success with multiple mechanistic bases for T cell exhaustion reversal[2]. Through multiple mechanisms, metformin reshapes the tumor immune microenvironment toward anti-tumor immunity. Metformin activates AMPK, leading to phosphorylation of PD-L1 at serine 195 and subsequent abnormal glycosylation and degradation of PD-L1, thereby blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 axis through a mechanism distinct from checkpoint blockade[2]. Beyond PD-L1 modulation, metformin reduces tryptophan uptake and alters tumor immune microenvironment composition, increasing CD8+ T cell and classical dendritic cell proportions while reducing neutrophil and immunosuppressive cell populations[2]. In colorectal cancer models, metformin combined with anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors synergistically enhanced anti-tumor immune responses, with combination therapy significantly prolonging overall survival and enhancing activity of NK cells, CD4+ T cells, and CD8+ T cells beyond either monotherapy[2]. These results suggest that signature reversal analysis querying the exhaustion signature against metformin-induced transcriptional changes would identify metformin as a candidate drug capable of reversing elements of the exhaustion phenotype.

Propranolol, a beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist approved for cardiovascular indications, has emerged as a candidate for enhancing checkpoint inhibitor efficacy through immunomodulatory mechanisms[2]. Propranolol inhibits tumor growth and metastasis while modulating immune cell function, restoring vitality of cytotoxic T cells and reducing myeloid-derived suppressor cell populations[2]. Mechanistically, propranolol mitigates the elevation of regulatory T cells induced by surgical stress in breast cancer patients undergoing mastectomy, suggesting that adrenergic signaling blockade can restore anti-tumor immune responses[2]. The combination of propranolol with checkpoint inhibitors has shown promise for enhancing T cell infiltration, reducing MDSC infiltration, and improving survival in tumor-bearing mouse models[2]. Like metformin, propranolol's mechanism of immune enhancement complements checkpoint blockade through distinct biological pathways, making it a strong candidate identified through signature reversal approaches targeting immunomodulatory effects beyond checkpoint axis regulation.

Lanatoside C, a cardiac glycoside previously approved for treating cardiac arrhythmias and other cardiac conditions, exemplifies a drug with broad-spectrum anti-cancer effects through multiple mechanisms relevant to T cell exhaustion[29]. In hepatocellular carcinoma models, Lanatoside C suppressed cancer cell growth in dose-dependent manner, blocked critical cell cycle phases, and triggered apoptosis through activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and MAPK/ERK pathways—pathways intimately connected to T cell metabolic status and T cell signaling[29]. In pancreatic cancer, Lanatoside C induced cell death through the ER stress/GRP78 pathway[29]. The diversity of anti-cancer mechanisms targeted by Lanatoside C, encompassing metabolic pathways, death pathways, and stress-response mechanisms, suggests that signature reversal analysis would identify this compound as capable of antagonizing multiple elements of the exhaustion program. The in vivo studies documenting anti-tumor effects of Lanatoside C in various cancer models provide proof-of-concept that repositioning for cancer immunotherapy could be effective[29].

## Validation and Translational Considerations

The identification of drug repositioning candidates through computational signature reversal and network analysis represents only the beginning of the translational pipeline. Subsequent validation steps are critical to confirm that predicted mechanisms are biologically relevant and that drug candidates indeed restore T cell function.

Experimental validation should begin with cell culture studies employing primary human T cells and exhausted T cell models[5][55]. Exhausted T cell models can be generated through chronic in vitro stimulation with cognate antigen or through co-culture with PD-L1-expressing tumor cells, which induces expression of exhaustion markers (PD-1, LAG-3, TIGIT, TIM-3) and reduces effector functions[4][5][55]. Treatment of these exhausted cultures with candidate drugs, followed by flow cytometry analysis of exhaustion marker expression and functional assays measuring IFN-γ, TNF-α, and cytokine secretion, quantifies the degree to which drugs restore T cell phenotype and function[5]. Single-cell RNA sequencing of drug-treated exhausted T cells can provide transcriptomic validation that drug effects align with predictions from signature reversal analysis, showing reversal of exhaustion-associated genes and upregulation of effector genes[4][40].

Mechanistic studies using knockout cell lines offer particular value for confirming the biological targets responsible for drug effects. Knockout cell lines lacking specific drug targets or downstream signaling components enable assessment of whether effects depend on predicted target engagement[56][59]. For example, if signature reversal identified a kinase inhibitor as a candidate for exhaustion reversal through hypothesized inhibition of a specific kinase, studies comparing responses of wild-type versus kinase knockout T cells would confirm target dependence[56][59]. This approach prevents pursuit of drugs whose effects result from off-target mechanisms unrelated to the disease phenotype[56][59].

Mouse tumor models and in vivo studies provide essential validation in realistic biological contexts. Immunocompetent tumor-bearing mice treated with candidate drugs while monitoring tumor growth, survival, T cell infiltration, and T cell phenotype validate whether computational predictions translate to in vivo efficacy[2][5]. Combination studies of repositioned drugs with approved checkpoint inhibitors assess whether predicted synergistic effects materialize[2][33]. Positive results in these preclinical models provide justification for clinical development, while negative results reveal that computational predictions failed to account for pharmacokinetic factors, metabolism, or other in vivo complexities[2][5].

Clinical considerations for translational advancement of repositioned drugs include regulatory pathway optimization. Because candidate drugs are already approved for other indications, the regulatory pathway to clinical testing for cancer immunotherapy can potentially proceed more rapidly than for novel compounds[20][26]. FDA guidance on efficacy supplements and new indication applications for approved drugs typically requires phase 2 efficacy data rather than the full phase 1-3 program required for new drugs, potentially reducing development time from 10-15 years to 3-5 years[20][26]. The safety database and manufacturing processes for repositioned drugs are already established, further streamlining development[20][26].

Biomarker development parallels drug candidate advancement. Identifying which patients are most likely to benefit from repositioned drug treatment—whether through exhaustion signature assessment in baseline tumors, genetic markers, or other biomarkers—would enhance clinical trial design and improve response rates[37][39][51][54]. The 25-gene T cell exhaustion signature validated in lung adenocarcinoma patients with high predictive accuracy for checkpoint inhibitor response represents an example of how exhaustion signature scores can be deployed as companion diagnostics to predict immunotherapy benefit[37]. Similar signatures could potentially be developed and validated for repositioned drug candidates to enable precision medicine approaches that maximize treatment efficacy while minimizing unnecessary exposure to patients unlikely to benefit[37][39][51][54].

## Conclusion and Future Directions

T cell exhaustion represents a fundamental barrier to effective cancer immunotherapy and chronic viral infection control, characterized by loss of effector functions and sustained expression of inhibitory receptors that render the exhausted state largely self-perpetuating. The integrated strategy presented in this report systematically combines signature reversal analysis with network pharmacology and multi-criteria decision-making to identify drug repositioning candidates capable of reversing T cell exhaustion through complementary mechanisms that may enhance checkpoint inhibitor efficacy or function independently.

The key strength of this integrated approach lies in its systematic incorporation of multiple evidence layers. Signature reversal analysis directly assesses whether candidate drugs produce transcriptional changes antagonistic to the exhaustion phenotype, leveraging large-scale drug perturbation databases encompassing hundreds of thousands of perturbation signatures[32][38]. Network analysis provides complementary mechanistic understanding by evaluating how drug targets functionally interact with known exhaustion-associated pathways and transcription factors. Multi-criteria prioritization frameworks synthesize diverse evidence types into actionable rankings that guide selection of candidates for downstream validation. This layered approach reduces the likelihood that high-ranked candidates result from noise or irrelevant mechanisms, increasing the probability of translational success.

The framework is particularly valuable for identifying drugs that act through mechanisms complementary to checkpoint blockade. As clinical resistance to checkpoint inhibitors remains a major challenge, with response rates typically ranging from 30-50% in many cancer types, identification of drugs that restore T cell function through distinct mechanisms offers the prospect of combination therapies with substantially improved efficacy[33][36][42]. The signature reversal approach naturally identifies such drugs by searching across diverse pharmacological agents for those capable of antagonizing the exhaustion program, regardless of their primary targets or initial therapeutic indication.

Future directions for this research include implementation of machine learning approaches that integrate transcriptomic, genomic, proteomic, and clinical data to develop more refined drug response prediction models[45][48][51][52]. Deep learning architectures that learn non-linear relationships between drug chemical structures, target binding properties, and transcriptional effects could enhance prediction accuracy beyond current connectivity-based approaches[45][48]. Temporal analysis of how drug effects unfold over time in cell culture and mouse models could refine prediction of which drugs produce durable versus transient exhaustion reversal[3]. Spatial analysis examining how drug effects vary across different regions of the tumor microenvironment would address the heterogeneity that precludes identification of universal exhaustion markers[4][37][40].

Integration of patient-derived xenograft models and organoid platforms provides opportunities to validate predicted drug effects in clinically relevant biological systems that more accurately recapitulate individual tumor heterogeneity[26][55][58]. The emerging use of advanced in vitro models such as organ-on-a-chip systems that capture interactions between T cells, tumor cells, and stromal elements offers unprecedented biological complexity for validation studies while maintaining experimental control and cost-effectiveness[58].

The development of combinatorial approaches targeting multiple nodes of the exhaustion network simultaneously represents another promising direction. Rather than identifying single drugs for repositioning, the framework could be extended to identify optimal two-drug or three-drug combinations that produce maximal reversal of the exhaustion signature through targeting of complementary pathways[33][39]. The ICBcomb database and similar resources aggregating clinical and preclinical data on combination therapies provide growing evidence about which mechanistic combinations prove most effective, enabling more informed selection of combinations for testing[39].

Ultimately, the successful translation of computational drug repositioning into clinical benefit will require iterative cycles of prediction, experimental validation, clinical testing, and refinement. The integrated framework described in this report provides a systematic foundation for identifying and prioritizing drug candidates with high probability of clinical relevance. As our understanding of T cell exhaustion mechanisms deepens and drug perturbation databases expand, this framework will increasingly enable rapid identification of therapeutic opportunities that transform cancer immunotherapy and chronic infection treatment into substantially more effective clinical realities.
