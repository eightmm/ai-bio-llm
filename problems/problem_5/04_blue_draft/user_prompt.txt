# Integrated Strategy for Drug Repositioning to Reverse T Cell Exhaustion: A Comprehensive Network-Based Analysis Framework

**Summary**: T cell exhaustion represents a critical barrier to effective cancer immunotherapy, wherein chronic antigen exposure induces a stable epigenetic and transcriptional state characterized by expression of inhibitory receptors, metabolic dysregulation, and loss of effector function. This report presents a comprehensive analysis strategy integrating T cell exhaustion gene signatures with drug-target networks and transcriptomic databases to systematically identify and prioritize drug repositioning candidates capable of reversing exhaustion phenotypes. The approach combines functional enrichment analysis of exhaustion-associated genes, network-based mapping of drug targets onto exhaustion pathways, and signature reversal frameworks to identify compounds that simultaneously inhibit upregulated exhaustion drivers and reactivate downregulated effector and memory-associated programs. By synthesizing evidence from transcriptomic, proteomic, and network pharmacology approaches, we propose a tiered prioritization scheme for drug candidates targeting key nodes in exhaustion biology, including metabolic checkpoints, epigenetic regulators, and checkpoint receptors. Mechanistic hypotheses linking specific drug targets to known exhaustion reversal pathways provide a rational basis for rational combination strategies and clinical translation.

## T Cell Exhaustion as a Central Obstacle to Immune Checkpoint Therapy

Exhausted T cells represent a distinctly differentiated state of CD8+ T lymphocytes that emerges under conditions of chronic antigen stimulation, particularly in the context of persistent viral infections, chronic parasitic infections, and the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment[1][4][19][22]. This phenotype is characterized by a constellation of molecular and functional deficits that collectively render these cells incapable of mounting effective anti-pathogenic or anti-tumor responses despite their persistence in the tissue. The hallmark features of exhausted T cells include sustained high expression of multiple inhibitory receptors such as programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1/PDCD1), lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (LAG-3), T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing-3 (TIM-3/HAVCR2), and T cell immunoglobulin and ITIM domain (TIGIT), alongside reduced production of effector cytokines including interferon-gamma (IFNγ), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα), and interleukin-2 (IL-2)[4][31]. Beyond surface receptor expression, exhausted T cells exhibit profound alterations in their metabolic programming, transcriptional landscape, and epigenetic state that collectively reinforce their dysfunctional phenotype and render them refractory to conventional stimulation[1][16][19][22].

The clinical significance of T cell exhaustion has been starkly underscored by the variable efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4 pathways in cancer patients. While ICIs have revolutionized treatment for select malignancies, particularly melanoma and non-small-cell lung cancer, only approximately 30% of patients with solid tumors achieve durable clinical benefit from these agents[21][23]. A substantial proportion of patients demonstrate primary resistance, failing to respond to ICI monotherapy from the outset, while others develop acquired resistance following initial response, a phenomenon termed "ICI escape."[23] Mechanistic investigations have revealed that multiple overlapping resistance pathways contribute to ICI failure, including but not limited to altered T cell exhaustion states, epigenetic silencing of antigen presentation machinery, immunosuppressive remodeling of the tumor microenvironment characterized by expansion of myeloid-derived suppressor cells and regulatory T cells, and genetic alterations in interferon-gamma signaling components[20][23]. Therefore, developing strategies to reverse or prevent T cell exhaustion has emerged as one of the most pressing challenges in cancer immunotherapy.

Drug repositioning, defined as the identification of novel therapeutic applications for existing approved or investigational drugs originally developed for different indications, represents a promising and pragmatic approach to rapidly identify candidate agents for reversing T cell exhaustion[2][5][6]. This strategy possesses inherent advantages in accelerated timeline for clinical translation, reduced development costs, established safety and toxicity profiles from prior clinical experience, and the opportunity to leverage large existing databases of drug-target interactions and drug-induced transcriptomic signatures[2][5][6]. The core principle underlying drug repositioning for exhaustion reversal is signature reversal, wherein drugs or drug combinations whose transcriptomic or pathway effects are most inverse to the exhaustion gene signature are hypothesized to counteract exhaustion and restore T cell effector function[6]. Integrating this concept with network pharmacology approaches that map drug targets onto cellular signaling networks and pathway architectures can substantially enhance the specificity and mechanistic interpretability of predictions.

## Part A: Comprehensive Analysis of T Cell Exhaustion Gene Signatures and Functional Pathways

### Characterization of Canonical Exhaustion-Associated Gene Expression Patterns

The development of high-resolution single-cell and bulk transcriptomic profiling technologies has enabled systematic identification of genes whose expression patterns robustly distinguish exhausted CD8+ T cells from effector and memory T cell states[1][4][22]. Consensus studies across multiple disease contexts, including chronic viral infections (HIV, hepatitis C virus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus), solid tumors (melanoma, colorectal cancer, non-small-cell lung cancer), and hematologic malignancies, have converged on a core set of exhaustion marker genes that display remarkable conservation across disease types[4]. These exhaustion signature genes can be categorized into several functional clusters based on their roles in T cell biology and exhaustion pathways.

The first major category encompasses inhibitory receptor genes, including PDCD1 (encoding PD-1), LAG3 (encoding LAG-3), HAVCR2 (encoding TIM-3), TIGIT, and CD39, among others[1][4][31]. These genes are consistently upregulated in exhausted T cells and their protein products mediate inhibitory signaling that suppresses T cell receptor (TCR) signaling, cytokine production, and proliferative capacity[7][31]. In addition to these classically recognized checkpoint receptors, CXCL13 and LAYN (layilin) have been identified as novel exhaustion marker genes with potential roles in T cell localization and function within inflamed tissues[4]. The upregulation of inhibitory receptor genes in exhaustion is not merely a passive consequence of chronic stimulation but rather appears to be actively driven by specific transcription factors, particularly thymocyte selection-associated HMG-box protein (TOX), which acts as a master regulator of exhaustion-specific transcriptional programs[43][46]. TOX-mediated activation of exhaustion marker genes appears to be maintained through continuous TOX expression even after exhaustion is established, and ablation of TOX in committed exhausted T cells disrupts the epigenetic landscape and enhances fate plasticity toward more functional effector-like states[46].

The second functional cluster of exhaustion signature genes comprises transcriptional regulators that control the exhaustion differentiation fate and are often distinct from those governing effector or memory T cell states[1][43][46]. Beyond TOX, these include transcription factors such as Eomesodermin (EOMES), which coordinates multiple aspects of exhaustion including upregulation of inhibitory receptors and downregulation of proliferative capacity[43]. The role of EOMES in exhaustion is nuanced, as high levels of EOMES promote exhaustion by suppressing T cell proliferation and chemotaxis while simultaneously enhancing apoptosis and hypoxia pathway signaling, whereas reducing EOMES levels increases TCF1 expression (a marker of T cell stemness) and diminishes exhaustion markers[43]. Additional exhaustion-associated transcription factors include BLIMP-1 (PR domain zinc finger protein 1, PRDM1), IRF4 (interferon regulatory factor 4), and NFATc1 (nuclear factor of activated T cells c1), which together orchestrate a transcriptional program distinctly different from those of effector or memory T cells[1][22][43].

The third cluster of exhaustion signature genes comprises metabolic enzymes and metabolic regulators whose altered expression patterns reflect and reinforce the metabolic dysregulation characteristic of exhausted T cells[16][42]. Exhausted T cells display a distinctive metabolic state intermediate between the highly glycolytic phenotype of effector T cells and the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS)-dependent metabolism of memory T cells[16][42]. This metabolic state is characterized by reduced glycolytic capacity, diminished glucose uptake, and impaired ability to rapidly shift metabolism in response to changing nutrient and oxygen availability[16][42]. Key genes in this category include those encoding glycolytic enzymes, glucose transporters (GLUT1/SLC2A1, GLUT3/SLC2A3), and regulators of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, which serves as a central metabolic hub controlling T cell fate decisions[13][16]. The downregulation of aerobic glycolysis-promoting genes combined with alterations in mitochondrial biogenesis and fatty acid oxidation capacity represents a critical checkpoint in exhaustion maintenance that can be therapeutically targeted to enhance exhaustion reversal[42].

The fourth major cluster encompasses epigenetic regulators and chromatin remodeling enzymes whose altered expression patterns contribute to the epigenetic "locking" that stabilizes the exhaustion phenotype[19][22]. Exhausted T cells exhibit distinctive histone modification patterns, with broad repressive marks (H3K27me3) over effector genes and selective retention of bivalent chromatin domains that maintain epigenetic plasticity while preventing rapid effector gene activation[22]. DNA methylation patterns in exhausted T cells are also distinctly remodeled, with selective hypermethylation of effector gene promoters and altered methylation at genes controlling exhaustion maintenance[22]. Enhanced expression of DNA methyltransferases and histone deacetylases (HDACs) in exhausted T cells contributes to this epigenetic repression and represents a potential therapeutic intervention point[22][38].

Recent advances in single-cell and single-cell chromatin accessibility analyses have revealed that exhaustion represents not a homogeneous state but rather a spectrum of distinct exhaustion substates, with progenitor-like exhausted T cells (Tpex cells) displaying enhanced stemness, proliferative capacity, and capacity for functional reinvigoration upon immune checkpoint blockade, in contrast to terminally exhausted T cells (Tex cells) with irreversible loss of effector capacity[7][31]. This heterogeneity has major implications for therapeutic targeting, as interventions effective for reversing progenitor exhaustion may not penetrate the terminally exhausted compartment.

### Functional Enrichment and Pathway Analysis of Exhaustion Signatures

To systematically interrogate the biological processes and molecular networks underlying exhaustion, comprehensive functional enrichment analysis of exhaustion-associated gene signatures must be performed using multiple complementary approaches. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis typically identifies enrichment for terms related to immune cell activation, cytokine production, cell proliferation, and positive regulation of T cell responses among downregulated genes in exhaustion, suggesting that these essential effector programs are actively suppressed[1][4]. Conversely, upregulated genes in exhaustion typically show enrichment for terms related to negative regulation of immune responses, cell death, and stress response pathways[1][4]. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis of exhaustion signatures consistently identifies enrichment in multiple intersecting pathway nodes, including the PD-1 signaling pathway, T cell receptor signaling, PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway, JAK-STAT signaling, and metabolic pathways including glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, and amino acid metabolism[1][4][16]. The integration of Reactome pathway database analysis[44] further reveals involvement of epigenetic pathways, transcriptional regulation, and innate immune signaling cascades that contribute to exhaustion maintenance.

In a recent comprehensive analysis of exhaustion signatures across multiple cancer types using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and additional transcriptomic datasets[1], an eight-gene exhaustion-related gene score (ERGS) was developed based on marker genes of exhausted CD8+ T cells, with genes including LAG3, PDCD1, HAVCR2, and additional co-expressed genes reflecting metabolic and epigenetic dysregulation. Notably, this signature was found to correlate strongly with infiltration of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), indicating that exhaustion-associated transcriptional programs in T cells are intimately connected with broader immunosuppressive remodeling of the tumor microenvironment[1]. Similarly, network analysis of exhaustion genes reveals that many upregulated genes function as transcription factors or signaling hubs with high betweenness centrality in protein-protein interaction networks, suggesting that multiple downstream effectors are coordinately controlled by a limited set of master regulators[8][25].

A critical finding from recent pathway analysis is that exhaustion-associated gene expression changes are accompanied by dramatic metabolic reprogramming that both enables and reinforces the exhausted state. Upregulated genes include those promoting lactate production, reduced glucose consumption, and impaired fatty acid oxidation, creating a metabolic environment hostile to effector T cell functions while simultaneously promoting survival of exhausted cells under nutrient-limited conditions[16][42]. The mTOR pathway occupies a central position in this metabolic network, with mTORC1 activity serving as a key determinant of whether T cells adopt glycolytic (effector), OXPHOS-dependent (memory), or metabolically compromised (exhausted) states[13][16]. Inhibition of mTORC1 through AMPK activation or direct mTOR inhibition can restore glycolytic capacity and promote T cell effector function, providing a mechanistic basis for targeting metabolic pathways to reverse exhaustion[42].

## Part B: Drug-Gene and Drug-Target Network-Based Candidate Discovery

### Integration of Drug-Target Databases with Exhaustion Pathways

The identification of drug repositioning candidates capable of reversing T cell exhaustion fundamentally depends on systematic mapping of drug targets onto the molecular networks and pathways identified in Part A. Multiple public databases provide comprehensive information on drug-target interactions, including DrugBank, the Therapeutic Target Database (TTD), the NIH LINCS Library, and Connectivity Map (CMAP), which catalog transcriptomic responses of cultured cells to thousands of small molecule perturbations[9][12][18]. These resources enable computational approaches to drug repositioning that go beyond simple target overlap and instead capture the full constellation of transcriptomic changes induced by each drug in biologically relevant cell types.

The ceSAR (connectivity enhanced structure-activity relationship) approach represents one advanced computational methodology for accelerating drug discovery and repurposing by combining transcriptional signature connectivity analysis with cheminformatic techniques[3]. This method integrates drug and target transcriptional signature concordance analysis with molecular docking to identify antagonists of specific targets by connecting transcriptional signatures of small molecules to the signature of a gene knockdown representing target inhibition[3]. By extending signature connectivity analysis beyond the LINCS library to arbitrary candidate compounds, ceSAR enables efficient ranking of candidate molecules based on chemical similarity and signature concordance, substantially reducing false-positive rates while cutting computational run times by multiple orders of magnitude[3].

The Connectivity Map (CMAP) and related signature-based approaches leverage the principle that drugs whose transcriptomic signatures are most inverse or discordant from a disease signature should theoretically reverse disease phenotypes[6][9]. A disease signature is derived from comparing gene expression in diseased tissue to healthy controls, identifying genes consistently upregulated or downregulated in disease. A drug is then scored based on the extent to which its transcriptomic signature reverses this disease signature—that is, downregulating upregulated disease genes and upregulating downregulated disease genes[6][9]. This signature reversion framework has been successfully applied to identify drug candidates for multiple low-survival cancers, including glioblastoma, pancreatic cancer, and cholangiocarcinoma[6].

A critical advancement in network-based drug discovery involves the integration of protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks with drug target information to identify drugs whose targets occupy critical positions within exhaustion-associated pathways[37][40]. Proteins serving as hubs within disease-relevant networks (those with high betweenness centrality or degree) may represent more effective therapeutic targets than peripheral proteins with similar biological associations, as targeting hub proteins disrupts multiple downstream pathways simultaneously[37][40]. Furthermore, proteins occupying positions proximal to disease modules within the interactome—those proteins most directly connected to known disease-associated proteins—may represent more specific and effective targets than distant proteins[37].

### Signature Reversal Framework Applied to Exhaustion

The signature reversal approach can be systematically applied to exhaustion reversal through the following workflow: First, an exhaustion gene signature is constructed by identifying genes with consistent differential expression between exhausted and non-exhausted T cells across multiple datasets, with careful attention to assigning directionality (upregulated vs. downregulated in exhaustion). Second, this exhaustion signature is compared against transcriptomic signatures of cells treated with each drug in the LINCS library or other perturbation databases[3][6][9][12]. Third, for each drug, a connectivity score is calculated measuring the extent to which the drug signature reverses the exhaustion signature, with negative scores indicating good reversal potential (downregulation of upregulated exhaustion genes and upregulation of downregulated genes)[6]. Fourth, drugs are ranked by their reversal score, and top-ranked candidates are subjected to mechanistic analysis focusing on their direct protein targets and downstream pathway effects.

The power of the signature reversion approach lies in its capture of the full transcriptomic context without requiring prior knowledge of specific exhaustion-driving targets. However, it has limitations including potential artifacts from cell line-specific responses that may not translate to primary T cells, and difficulty in definitively establishing the causal targets responsible for reversal effects[6]. To address these limitations, signature reversal results should be complemented with mechanistic analysis of direct drug targets and pathway topology.

### Network Proximity and Multi-Target Approaches to Drug Combination Design

Recent advances in network pharmacology have established that drug efficacy depends not merely on the presence of targets in disease-relevant pathways but on the spatial proximity of drug targets to disease proteins within the interactome[37][40]. The network proximity concept quantifies the relationship between drug targets and disease proteins by calculating the shortest path distance between drug targets and disease-associated proteins in comprehensive PPI networks, generating a network proximity z-score that indicates whether a drug's targets are significantly closer to disease proteins than would be expected by chance[37]. This approach has proven superior to simple target overlap methods in predicting clinical efficacy of monotherapies and predicting synergistic effects of drug combinations.

Building on network proximity principles, optimal drug combinations for exhaustion reversal should simultaneously target multiple communication hubs and alternative pathway nodes identified through network topology analysis[11][37]. Cancer cells exploit parallel compensatory signaling pathways to develop resistance, and targeting only one pathway frequently permits adaptation through activation of alternative inputs[11][37]. A network-based approach to drug combination design identifies key mediator proteins occupying positions of high betweenness centrality within exhaustion-relevant networks, then selects combinations that target proteins on distinct parallel pathways and their connectors[11]. This approach has successfully predicted synergistic combinations in breast and colorectal cancers, and similar logic can be applied to exhaustion reversal.

### Machine Learning-Based Prediction of Drug-Response Biomarkers

Advanced machine learning (ML) approaches have recently been deployed to identify robust biomarkers predictive of immunotherapy response and to integrate multiple layers of omics data for improved predictive accuracy[8][33][36]. Network-based machine learning frameworks that leverage graph convolutional networks or other topology-aware ML approaches have demonstrated superior performance compared to conventional biomarker-based prediction in identifying patients likely to respond to immune checkpoint inhibitors[8]. The principle underlying network-based ML approaches is that robust biomarkers exist not as isolated genes but rather as coherent modules within biological networks, and identifying these modules requires methods that explicitly consider network topology[8].

In the context of drug repositioning for exhaustion reversal, ML approaches can be applied to identify the combination of drug targets and transcriptomic features most predictive of exhaustion reversal capacity[33][36]. Random Forest, XGBoost, and neural network classifiers trained on data from drugs with known effects on exhaustion can identify the feature importance and relative contributions of different drug target categories and pathway modulations to overall exhaustion reversal efficacy[33][36]. Cross-validation across multiple datasets and cell types enables assessment of the robustness and generalizability of these predictive models[33][36].

## Part C: Prioritization of Drug Candidates and Mechanistic Hypotheses for Exhaustion Reversal

### Candidate Drug Categories Based on Mechanistic Targets

The systematic analysis of T cell exhaustion biology reveals multiple distinct mechanistic nodes amenable to therapeutic intervention through drug repositioning. These nodes can be organized into several major categories based on their position within exhaustion regulatory networks and potential mechanisms of action.

**Metabolic Reprogramming via mTOR and AMPK Pathway Modulation**: Metformin represents a particularly promising drug repositioning candidate for exhaustion reversal, as this FDA-approved anti-diabetic agent possesses multiple immune-modulatory mechanisms directly relevant to exhaustion reversal[2][5][42]. Metformin inhibits the mTOR pathway through AMPK activation, shifting metabolic programming from the glycolytic state of activated effector T cells toward a more balanced metabolic state with enhanced oxidative phosphorylation capacity[2][16][42]. In colorectal cancer models treated with metformin, researchers observed substantial remodeling of the tumor microenvironment characterized by increased infiltration of CD8+ T cells and decreased infiltration of immunosuppressive CD4+ T cells, alongside elevated populations of macrophages and dendritic cells promoting anti-tumor immunity[2]. Mechanistically, metformin reduces tryptophan uptake by tumor cells, thereby reducing the immunosuppressive kynurenine pathway that is driven by indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) and contributes to T cell exhaustion[2]. Furthermore, metformin directly blocks the PD-1/PD-L1 axis through AMPK-mediated phosphorylation of PD-L1 at serine 195, promoting abnormal glycosylation and subsequent proteasomal degradation of PD-L1 on tumor cells, thereby reducing PD-1-mediated T cell inhibition[2][42].

The efficacy of metformin in enhancing anti-tumor T cell responses has been validated in multiple animal models including colorectal cancer, melanoma, and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, with combination of metformin and chemoradiotherapy significantly prolonging overall survival while enhancing NK cell, CD4+ T cell, and CD8+ T cell activity[2]. This evidence provides strong mechanistic and empirical support for metformin as a high-priority drug repositioning candidate for exhaustion reversal, potentially through combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors or metabolic pathway inhibitors targeting complementary nodes.

**β-Adrenergic Antagonist-Mediated Immune Restoration**: β-receptor antagonists, exemplified by propranolol, represent another compelling drug repositioning category for exhaustion reversal, with preclinical and clinical evidence supporting their capacity to restore exhausted T cell function and enhance immune checkpoint inhibitor efficacy[2]. Propranolol modulates the functional activity of immune cells by restoring vitality of cytotoxic T cells while reducing myeloid-derived suppressor cell populations[2]. In a mouse model of pancreatic cancer, whereas immune checkpoint inhibitors alone or combined with selective β2 receptor blockers failed to shrink tumors, propranolol-mediated non-selective β-receptor antagonism demonstrated substantial capacity to sensitize otherwise ICI-resistant tumors to anti-PD-1 checkpoint blockade[2]. Mechanistically, propranolol appears to operate through multiple pathways including reduction of stress-induced catecholamine signaling that is known to promote regulatory T cell expansion and suppress effector T cell function, as well as direct modulation of myeloid cell phenotypes to reduce MDSC infiltration and promote M1 macrophage polarization[2].

**JAK-STAT Pathway Inhibition for Exhaustion Reversal**: The JAK-STAT signaling pathway represents a crucial node in T cell activation, differentiation, and exhaustion regulation, with cytokine-induced STAT activation serving as a fundamental mechanism controlling T cell fate decisions[25][28]. Recent studies have demonstrated that JAK-STAT pathway members display widespread baseline activity in unstimulated immune cells, with STAT2 and IRF9 serving as the most important regulators under homeostatic conditions[25]. Dysregulation of JAK-STAT signaling contributes to exhaustion through multiple mechanisms, including altered IL-2 signaling required for T cell proliferation and altered IL-10 signaling that promotes T cell suppression and exhaustion[25][28]. JAK inhibitors, including ruxolitinib, tofacitinib, and baricitinib, represent FDA-approved agents for multiple inflammatory and malignant conditions that could be repositioned for exhaustion reversal by restoring dysregulated cytokine signaling.

**Epigenetic Modulators Targeting Exhaustion Chromatin State**: The epigenetic "locking" that stabilizes exhaustion through repressive histone modifications and altered DNA methylation represents a critical target for exhaustion reversal[19][22][38]. HDAC inhibitors such as panobinostat have demonstrated capacity to increase major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I expression on tumor cells while simultaneously increasing CD8+ T cell infiltration in some tumor models[38]. However, the relationship between HDAC inhibition and T cell function is complex, as HDAC inhibitors can simultaneously promote both immune-stimulatory effects (enhanced MHC-I expression, increased T cell infiltration) and immune-suppressive effects (expansion of regulatory T cells, inhibition of CD4+ T cell function)[38]. These observations support the rationale for combining HDAC inhibition with immune checkpoint blockade, with appropriate sequencing and dosing to maximize immune-stimulatory effects while minimizing T-regulatory cell expansion.

BET (bromodomain and extraterminal protein) inhibitors such as JQ1 have emerged as particularly promising epigenetic modulators for exhaustion reversal, with demonstrated capacity to downregulate PD-L1 expression on tumor cells through BRD4 inhibition while simultaneously upregulating MHC-I expression[49][52]. JQ1 enhances MHC-I-mediated cytotoxicity of antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes and synergizes with PD-1 checkpoint blockade in colorectal cancer and other tumor models[49]. Mechanistically, JQ1-mediated BRD4 inhibition blocks BRD4 binding to the CD274 (PD-L1) promoter, preventing its transcriptional activation, while simultaneously enhancing the transcription of MHC-I genes and other genes involved in antigen presentation[49].

**Checkpoint Receptor Antagonism Beyond PD-1**: While anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies have revolutionized cancer immunotherapy, alternative checkpoint receptors including LAG-3, TIM-3, and TIGIT represent additional targets amenable to drug repositioning[7][31][34]. PSGL-1 (P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1, encoded by SELPLG) has been identified as a previously unrecognized exhaustion-associated receptor that, despite its link with T cell exhaustion, requires its ongoing expression for optimal maintenance and differentiation of progenitor exhausted T cells into long-lived exhaustion-persisting cells[7]. Deletion of PSGL-1 in exhausted T cells combined with anti-PD-L1 treatment synergistically reinvigorates exhausted T cells more effectively than anti-PD-L1 treatment alone, demonstrating that combinatorial checkpoint targeting beyond the canonical PD-1/PD-L1 axis can substantially enhance exhaustion reversal[7]. LAG-3 expression is particularly associated with an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment with high levels of CD8+ T cell exhaustion and poor response to anti-PD-1 monotherapy, suggesting that LAG-3 blockade may selectively enhance exhaustion reversal in LAG-3-high tumors[34].

**Immunomodulatory Drugs and Metabolite Manipulation**: Thalidomide and its 2nd-generation analogs (lenalidomide, pomalidomide) represent immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) with pleiotropic effects on immune cell function, originally identified through phenotypic screening and subsequently found to mediate their anti-tumor effects through multiple mechanisms including enhanced T cell proliferation, augmented NK cell function, and reduced regulatory T cell populations[27]. The mechanisms by which IMiDs enhance immune function involve cereblon binding and consequent ubiquitination and degradation of IKZF1 and IKZF3, but downstream effects on T cell exhaustion remain incompletely characterized and warrant further investigation.

### Specific Drug Candidates with Prioritization and Mechanistic Hypotheses

Based on the comprehensive analysis framework presented above, the following drug candidates emerge as particularly high-priority targets for investigation in T cell exhaustion reversal:

**Rank 1 Priority Candidates**:

*Metformin*: As discussed above, metformin simultaneously targets multiple exhaustion-relevant nodes including metabolic reprogramming, PD-L1 degradation, and reversal of immunosuppressive metabolite pathways. The drug possesses established safety in human populations, established dose-response relationships, and multiple clinical trials already underway investigating its combination with immunotherapy. Proposed mechanism: AMPK activation→mTORC1 inhibition→enhanced glycolytic capacity and CD8+ T cell proliferation; PD-L1 phosphorylation and degradation; reduced kynurenine production. Clinical translation pathway: Phase II combination trials with anti-PD-1 in ICI-resistant cancers.

*JQ1 (BET Inhibitor)*: The demonstrated capacity of JQ1 to simultaneously downregulate PD-L1 while upregulating MHC-I, combined with enhanced CD8+ T cell infiltration in multiple tumor models, makes BET inhibition a high-priority mechanism for exhaustion reversal. BRD4 inhibition also potentially disrupts the epigenetic state maintaining exhaustion by reducing chromatin accessibility at exhaustion-specific loci. Proposed mechanism: BRD4 inhibition→reduced CD274/PD-L1 transcription→decreased PD-1-mediated T cell suppression; enhanced MHC-I expression and antigen presentation; potential disruption of exhaustion-specific chromatin state. Clinical translation pathway: Phase I/II combinations with anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 in multiple tumor types.

*Propranolol (β-receptor Antagonist)*: The capacity of propranolol to enhance exhaustion reversal in otherwise ICI-resistant pancreatic cancer models, combined with its extensive prior clinical use and safety data, makes this an attractive drug repositioning candidate. The mechanism involving stress-induced catecholamine signaling as a driver of exhaustion is mechanistically distinct from checkpoint and metabolic pathways. Proposed mechanism: Non-selective β-receptor antagonism→reduced catecholamine-induced immunosuppression→enhanced CD8+ T cell effector function and reduced Treg expansion; MDSC reduction and reduced immunosuppressive myeloid activation. Clinical translation pathway: Phase II trials combining propranolol with anti-PD-1 in ICI-resistant cancers.

**Rank 2 Priority Candidates**:

*JAK Inhibitors (Ruxolitinib, Tofacitinib)*: These FDA-approved agents for inflammatory and hematologic malignancies possess potential to restore dysregulated cytokine signaling in exhausted T cells, though optimal dosing and patient selection require clarification. The breadth of JAK-STAT pathway involvement in T cell fate decisions suggests broad potential for exhaustion reversal but also poses risks of immunosuppression if JAK inhibition is excessive. Proposed mechanism: Selective JAK inhibition→enhanced IL-2 and IL-7 signaling in T cells→increased proliferation and effector function; reduced IL-10-mediated T cell suppression. Clinical translation pathway: Phase I/II dose-finding studies in combination with anti-PD-1.

*HDAC Inhibitors (Panobinostat)*: While HDAC inhibition possesses both immune-stimulatory and immune-suppressive effects that must be carefully balanced, the capacity to enhance MHC-I expression and CD8+ T cell infiltration supports further investigation in combination strategies. Proposed mechanism: HDAC inhibition→enhanced MHC-I and antigen presentation; disruption of exhaustion-specific repressive chromatin state; concurrent effects on Treg expansion requiring careful combination design. Clinical translation pathway: Phase I/II combinations with anti-PD-1, with careful attention to sequencing and dose escalation.

**Rank 3 Priority Candidates**:

*Checkpoint Receptor Antagonists (Anti-LAG-3, Anti-TIM-3, Anti-TIGIT)*: Beyond PD-1 monotherapy, dual or triple checkpoint targeting offers potential to address redundancy in inhibitory receptor signaling. Proposed mechanism: Simultaneous blockade of multiple inhibitory pathways→enhanced T cell receptor signaling and effector function; broader reversal of exhaustion phenotype. Clinical translation pathway: Combination trials with anti-PD-1 in LAG-3-high or TIM-3-high tumors.

*Immunomodulatory Drugs (Lenalidomide)*: The established capacity of IMiDs to enhance T cell function combined with their existing clinical use warrants investigation of their potential to reverse exhaustion. Proposed mechanism: Cereblon-mediated IKZF1/IKZF3 degradation→altered T cell differentiation balance→enhanced effector T cell populations; potential reversal of exhaustion-associated transcriptional programs. Clinical translation pathway: Phase I/II trials investigating lenalidomide with anti-PD-1.

### Mechanistic Validation and Network-Based Rationale for Top Candidates

To rigorously validate the mechanistic hypotheses proposed for leading drug candidates, multiple orthogonal approaches should be employed. Transcriptomic analysis of exhausted T cells treated with candidate drugs in vitro or derived from tumors in mice treated with drugs plus checkpoint blockade can directly test whether drug treatment results in reversal of exhaustion signature genes, including upregulation of downregulated effector genes and downregulation of upregulated exhaustion marker genes[1][6]. These analyses should employ single-cell RNA-sequencing to preserve cellular heterogeneity and identify whether drugs selectively affect progenitor versus terminal exhaustion substates[7][22].

Epigenetic profiling through ATAC-seq (Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin) and ChIP-seq can directly measure whether drug treatment reverses the epigenetic "locking" of exhaustion, including increased chromatin accessibility at effector genes and reduced repressive histone modifications at exhaustion-associated loci[19][22]. Metabolic profiling through Seahorse metabolic flux analysis or mass spectrometry-based metabolomics can quantify whether drug treatment restores glycolytic capacity or enhances metabolic flexibility in exhausted T cells[16][39][42]. Finally, functional assays measuring exhausted T cell proliferation, cytokine production, and cytotoxicity ex vivo and in vivo animal models provide the ultimate validation of exhaustion reversal capacity[1][7][31][34].

The network-based rationale for the top candidates can be visualized and understood through the lens of protein interaction networks and signaling pathway topologies. Metformin's effects on mTOR, AMPK, and PD-L1 place it at the intersection of metabolic control and checkpoint signaling, two nodes identified as central to exhaustion maintenance. JQ1's effects on BRD4 and subsequent modulation of both PD-L1 expression and chromatin accessibility position it at the interface of checkpoint signaling and epigenetic control. Propranolol's effects on catecholamine-mediated immune suppression represent a distinct parallel pathway orthogonal to checkpoint and metabolic axes. The diversity of mechanisms represented by these candidates suggests that combinations targeting multiple network nodes may achieve synergistic exhaustion reversal superior to single-agent approaches.

## Integration of Spatial and Temporal Dynamics in Exhaustion Reversal

Recent advances in spatial transcriptomics and proteomics have revealed that T cell exhaustion exists not as a uniform tissue-wide phenomenon but rather as a spatially heterogeneous landscape with distinct exhaustion states occupying different spatial compartments within the tumor microenvironment and tumor-draining lymph nodes[48][56][59]. Exhausted T cells displaying high expression of inhibitory receptors tend to be localized in close proximity to tumor cells, while progenitor-like exhausted T cells with enhanced reinvigoration potential tend to occupy distinct spatial domains[48][56]. Drug-induced exhaustion reversal therefore must be evaluated not solely through transcriptomic changes in bulk populations but through spatially resolved analyses that capture how drug effects propagate through tissue architecture to reach physically sequestered exhausted T cells.

Furthermore, temporal dynamics of exhaustion development and reversal remain incompletely characterized. Early exhaustion, developing within days of chronic antigen exposure, may differ substantially from late exhaustion that develops after weeks or months and involves progressively more stable epigenetic remodeling and transcriptional state[22][46]. Drug candidates effective at reversing early exhaustion may prove ineffective against the epigenetically entrenched late exhaustion state, and vice versa. Understanding these temporal dynamics will be essential for optimal timing of drug administration in clinical trials.

## Challenges and Future Directions

Despite the promising mechanistic rationale for multiple drug repositioning candidates, substantial challenges remain in translating preclinical insights into effective clinical strategies. First, most preclinical studies of exhaustion reversal employ murine models where the temporal dynamics of exhaustion development and the specific tumor microenvironment composition differ from human cancers, potentially limiting translatability of findings. Second, the identification of patient populations most likely to benefit from specific exhaustion reversal strategies remains underdeveloped, with predictive biomarkers beyond PD-L1 and tumor mutational burden still under development[8][33][36]. Third, optimal sequencing and dosing of combination therapies involving exhaustion reversal agents with checkpoint inhibitors remains largely empirical, with mechanistic understanding of potential antagonistic interactions inadequate to fully guide clinical trial design.

Looking forward, development of novel single-cell spatial transcriptomics platforms enabling direct measurement of drug-induced transcriptomic changes in primary patient-derived T cells within intact tumor explants would substantially enhance prediction of clinical efficacy[32][56][59]. Machine learning approaches integrating genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and spatial data at single-cell resolution may identify novel exhaustion subtypes and their selective vulnerabilities to specific drug interventions[8][33][36]. Finally, systematic clinical trials employing adaptive designs and biomarker-driven patient enrichment will be essential to identify which drug repositioning candidates deliver meaningful survival benefits compared to checkpoint inhibitor monotherapy or standard combination approaches.

## Conclusions

T cell exhaustion represents a critical barrier to effective cancer immunotherapy, and drug repositioning offers a pragmatic approach to rapidly identify candidate agents for exhaustion reversal. By integrating comprehensive analysis of exhaustion gene signatures, systematic mapping of drug targets onto exhaustion pathways, and signature reversal frameworks informed by large public transcriptomic databases, we have identified multiple mechanistically distinct drug candidates with potential to reverse exhaustion. Leading candidates including metformin, JQ1, propranolol, and selective JAK inhibitors represent diverse mechanistic approaches targeting metabolic dysregulation, epigenetic remodeling, checkpoint signaling, and inflammatory pathways that collectively contribute to exhaustion maintenance. Rigorous validation through transcriptomic, epigenetic, and functional approaches combined with spatially and temporally resolved analyses will be essential to prioritize candidates for clinical development. Ultimately, rational combination strategies targeting multiple exhaustion-associated network nodes simultaneously are likely to achieve the most durable exhaustion reversal and enhanced anti-tumor immunity. The framework presented here provides a generalizable approach applicable to exhaustion reversal in diverse tumor types and chronic viral infections, and may be extended to drug repositioning for other chronic immune dysfunction states characterized by distinctive gene expression signatures.

# Data analysis summary (Data analysis output)
### 1. Data Overview

The dataset consists of multiple differential gene expression (DEG) result files derived from a T cell exhaustion time-course experiment, along with a small metadata file describing experimental conditions. Each DEG file contains 36,255 rows, corresponding to genome-wide gene-level measurements, and represents a pairwise comparison between two biological conditions or time points. These files are CSV-formatted tables suitable for downstream bioinformatics analysis.

Specifically, four DEG files capture longitudinal comparisons within the exhausted T cell condition at different late time points relative to day 14 (L14 vs L7, L21 vs L14, L35 vs L14, L60 vs L14), enabling characterization of exhaustion progression. Two additional DEG files compare exhausted (E) versus non-exhausted/less exhausted (L) T cells at early time points (day 5 and day 7), providing contrast between functional and dysfunctional states. The metadata file contains 10 rows describing experimental days, conditions, and categories.

Overall, the data are highly usable for defining a robust T cell exhaustion gene signature, as they provide genome-wide fold changes, statistical significance, and expression abundance (TPM) across multiple biologically relevant contrasts. While no explicit drug-related data are included, the DEG outputs are well suited for integration with external drug–target and drug–transcriptomic databases for drug repositioning analysis.

### 3. Data Integrity & Quality

All DEG files have consistent row counts (36,255), indicating genome-wide coverage and consistent gene ordering. Gene identifiers appear unique within each file, supporting reliable joins across contrasts. There is no explicit indication of missing values in the summary, but downstream checks for NA values in log2FoldChange or padj are recommended. The “Unnamed: 0” column should be verified to ensure it contains standardized gene identifiers, as inconsistent gene naming could complicate integration with drug databases. Overall statistical quality appears high, as adjusted p-values are provided, enabling rigorous significance filtering.

### 4. Sub-Problem Analysis: Data Applicability

**Sub-problem 1: Integrated Strategy for Drug Repositioning to Reverse T Cell Exhaustion**

The primary files needed are all DEG CSV files, particularly the early exhausted vs non-exhausted comparisons (day5 L5_vs_E5 and day7 L7_vs_E7) to define core exhaustion signatures, and the longitudinal late-time comparisons (L14, L21, L35, L60) to identify persistent or terminal exhaustion genes. Key columns are Unnamed: 0 (gene ID), log2FoldChange, and padj. The data are sufficient to define upregulated exhaustion drivers and downregulated effector genes. Recommended filtering includes padj < 0.05 and absolute log2FoldChange thresholds to define robust signatures. These signatures can then be mapped externally to drug–target and drug-induced expression resources, fulfilling the requirements of the sub-problem.

---

### 5. Biological Context (from Data)

The data represent transcriptomic profiles of T cells undergoing exhaustion across multiple time points, likely in a chronic infection or tumor-like setting. Early comparisons (day 5 and 7) contrast exhausted versus functional T cells, capturing initiation of exhaustion. Later comparisons track transcriptional drift from intermediate (day 14) to very late exhaustion (day 60). The organism is implicitly mammalian, most likely mouse, based on time-course design common in murine chronic infection models. The tissue context is T cells, without further subdivision, but the patterns are relevant to CD8+ T cell exhaustion biology.

### 6. Recommendations for Solver

**Key Keys**: Use the gene identifier in the “Unnamed: 0” column as the primary join key across all DEG files and for mapping to external drug–gene databases.  
**Pitfalls**: Avoid assuming gene symbols are unique across species or databases without normalization. Do not rely solely on raw p-values; always prioritize padj.  
**Priority**: The most critical step is defining a consistent exhaustion gene signature by intersecting significantly dysregulated genes across early and late time points, as this signature underpins all downstream drug repositioning analyses.

---

### 7. Domain Knowledge Injection

T cell exhaustion is characterized by upregulation of inhibitory receptors such as PDCD1 (PD-1), CTLA4, LAG3, HAVCR2 (TIM-3), and transcription factors like TOX and NR4A family members, alongside downregulation of effector molecules such as IFNG, GZMB, and TNF. Early time points often reflect activation-induced stress and initial inhibitory signaling, whereas late time points capture epigenetically stabilized dysfunction. TPM values represent normalized expression abundance; genes with very low TPM despite significant fold change should be interpreted cautiously. Typical significance thresholds are padj < 0.05 with |log2FoldChange| > 0.5–1.0 for biologically meaningful effects.

---

### 8. Data Integration Strategy (Natural Language - NO CODE)

First, align all DEG files using the gene identifier column to create a unified table where each gene has fold changes and significance values across all comparisons. Early exhaustion signatures should be derived by selecting genes consistently upregulated in E versus L at days 5 and 7, while late exhaustion maintenance genes should be those persistently dysregulated from day 14 through day 60. Mismatches in gene identifiers across files should be resolved by filtering to the intersection set present in all files. After integration, the expected row count will remain close to 36,255 genes, with some reduction if filtering for significance or consistency is applied.

---

### 9. Step-by-Step Analysis Workflow (Natural Language - NO CODE)

Step 1 involves loading all DEG and metadata files and validating gene identifiers and statistical columns.  
Step 2 defines early T cell exhaustion signatures by filtering day 5 and day 7 comparisons for significantly upregulated and downregulated genes in exhausted cells.  
Step 3 characterizes exhaustion progression by examining longitudinal DEG files to identify genes whose dysregulation persists or intensifies over time.  
Step 4 consolidates these results into a core exhaustion gene signature, separating upregulated inhibitory/metabolic regulators from downregulated effector/memory genes.  
Step 5 integrates this signature with external drug–target and drug-induced transcriptomic databases to score drugs based on their ability to reverse the exhaustion signature.  
Step 6 prioritizes candidate drugs using reversal strength, relevance of targets to T cell biology, and clinical development status.  
The final step combines ranked drug candidates with mechanistic hypotheses linking drug targets to known exhaustion pathways, while performing quality checks such as signature robustness and biological plausibility.
