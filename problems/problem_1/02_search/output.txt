# Integrated Multi-Modal Strategy for Quantifying T-Cell Gene Functional Similarity and Identifying Critical Resting-State Regulatory Gene Pairs

This report presents a comprehensive, implementation-ready analysis strategy for integrating T-cell gene expression data with computational functional, evolutionary, and structural annotations to systematically identify gene pairs that regulate resting T-cell states (naive and memory populations). The strategy synthesizes large language models with phylogenetic comparative methods, expression correlation analysis, and protein structure prediction to generate a unified Function Similarity Score that captures functional relatedness across multiple biological modalities. By leveraging recent advances in computational transcriptomics, knowledge-based gene annotation, and multi-modal similarity integration, the proposed pipeline enables both discovery of known regulatory relationships within quiescence and activation pathways and the identification of previously unexplored gene interactions critical for maintaining resting T-cell homeostasis.

## Data Integration and Preprocessing Strategy

Successful analysis of T-cell gene functional similarity requires comprehensive data preparation that harmonizes multiple data sources while preserving biological signal and minimizing technical artifacts. The foundation of this analysis rests on the integration of transcriptomic expression profiles (TPM units) spanning multiple T-cell phenotypes, including resting states (naive and memory T cells from both CD4 and CD8 lineages) and activated states (TH0, TH1, TH2, TH17, TREG, and time-course samples at 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 hours post-activation). This diversity of cellular states is critical for understanding the full transcriptional landscape underlying T-cell quiescence and activation.

The initial preprocessing phase should establish a unified gene identifier system that reconciles Ensembl gene IDs (ENSMUSG format for mouse) with gene symbols provided in the genelist.csv file. This harmonization step is essential because multiple genes may map to the same symbol across different annotations, and conversely, a single gene may be represented by multiple transcript variants or isoforms. Establishing a single canonical identifier per gene—preferably using the stable Ensembl gene ID—ensures consistency across all downstream analyses and prevents erroneous duplication or loss of information[1]. Additionally, duplicate entries should be identified and consolidated using the most recent annotation; if expression data exists for multiple isoforms of the same gene, expression values should be aggregated (via median or mean) to generate a single expression vector per gene.

Following identifier harmonization, the expression preprocessing pipeline should account for the inherent characteristics of TPM (transcripts per million) data, which are already normalized for library size but may contain batch effects, dropout events, or systematic biases related to sequencing depth or processing protocols. The standard approach involves applying a log-transformation (log1p) to stabilize variance and improve the normality assumption for downstream correlation and statistical testing. This transformation prevents extreme values from dominating similarity calculations and enables the use of distance metrics and learning algorithms that assume approximately normal distributions. Concurrently, genes with consistently low expression across all samples should be filtered to reduce noise and computational burden; a typical threshold might retain genes with mean TPM above 1 or 5, though this cutoff should be validated by examining the distribution of mean expression values and by sensitivity analysis[1].

If metadata indicates the presence of technical or biological batch effects (e.g., samples processed across different time periods, sequencing runs, or laboratories), batch correction should be applied using methods designed for TPM or count-based data. Traditional batch correction methods such as ComBat are optimized for data following a normal distribution after appropriate transformation; applying limma's removeBatchEffect on log-transformed TPM data, with batch specified as a nuisance variable and the design matrix accounting for biological condition (resting vs. activated), can effectively remove systematic variation while preserving condition-specific signals[1]. This step is particularly important if the TPM data were generated from multiple sources or protocols, as systematic biases can inflate or deflate expression-based similarity estimates.

Crucially, the analysis should explicitly define sample groupings for stratification in similarity calculations. At minimum, samples should be categorized into two primary groups: resting T cells (including naive and memory populations) and activated T cells (including all TH subsets and time-course samples). Within the resting group, further stratification by CD4 versus CD8 lineage is recommended, as these populations possess distinct transcriptional programs despite shared aspects of quiescence. For activated samples, stratification by specific phenotype (TH0, TH1, TH2, TH17, TREG) and by time point (if available) preserves the resolution needed to assess how expression patterns evolve during activation and to identify genes specifically associated with quiescence maintenance across diverse activated states. This hierarchical sample organization facilitates downstream computation of condition-specific expression patterns and enables the calculation of effect sizes (e.g., log fold-changes, AUROC statistics) that quantify the degree to which genes are preferentially expressed or quiescent in resting cells.

## LLM-Based Functional Characterization of T-Cell Genes

Recent advances in large language models have demonstrated their capacity to integrate distributed biological knowledge and generate novel functional insights about genes and gene sets when provided with appropriate contextual information and verification mechanisms[2][5]. Rather than relying solely on existing, potentially incomplete or outdated gene ontology annotations, an LLM-based approach can synthesize current literature, pathway databases, and functional studies to produce rich, contextually relevant functional summaries for T-cell genes. This is particularly valuable for T-cell biology, where functional relationships between genes are often condition- and differentiation-stage-dependent, and where resting T-cell quiescence involves the repression or inhibition of activation pathways rather than the absence of specific gene products.

The computational strategy for LLM-based gene functional summarization centers on a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, which combines the reasoning capabilities of large language models with the factual grounding of curated biological knowledge bases[2][5]. Rather than relying on the LLM's training knowledge alone—which may contain inaccuracies, hallucinations, or outdated information—a RAG system first retrieves relevant factual statements about each gene from authoritative sources, then prompts the LLM to synthesize these facts into a coherent summary. For T-cell-related genes, critical sources to include in the retrieval step are UniProtKB (for protein function annotations), the Gene Ontology (GO) database (for standardized biological process and cellular component terms), pathway databases such as Reactome and KEGG (for pathway membership and mechanism), and mouse-specific resources such as the Mouse Genome Database (MGD) and the International Mouse Phenotype Consortium (IMPC) (for condition-specific phenotypes).

The prompt engineering stage should explicitly request summaries addressing dimensions of T-cell biology central to understanding quiescence and activation. These dimensions include: (1) roles in antigen recognition and T-cell receptor signaling; (2) involvement in the transition from naive to activated states, including roles in cytokine signaling and transcriptional regulation; (3) association with memory T-cell differentiation and maintenance of quiescence; (4) participation in specific T-cell subsets (CD4, CD8, regulatory T cells, etc.) or functional states (effector, helper, cytotoxic, etc.); (5) involvement in metabolic remodeling during activation and quiescence; (6) participation in immune checkpoint control and exhaustion pathways; and (7) known protein-protein interactions with other T-cell regulatory proteins. By explicitly structuring the LLM query around these dimensions, the output becomes more directly applicable to the subsequent steps of computing semantic similarity and prioritizing functionally relevant gene pairs.

A critical enhancement to basic LLM summarization is the incorporation of a self-verification mechanism, as exemplified by GeneAgent and similar systems[5]. After the LLM generates a preliminary functional summary, this summary should be automatically cross-checked against the same curated databases used in the initial retrieval step. The verification step identifies any claims in the summary that lack explicit support in the retrieved facts, flags potential hallucinations or inferences that go beyond the available evidence, and iteratively refines the summary until all key claims are grounded in citations or are explicitly marked as inferred hypotheses. This self-verification loop substantially reduces the rate of unfounded claims while preserving the value of the LLM's synthesizing and reasoning capabilities. The final output for each gene should be structured as a record containing: a concise functional summary (1-3 sentences); expanded discussion of key processes and pathways (structured by the dimensions listed above); a list of key protein-protein interactions and regulatory relationships; a "T-cell quiescence/memory relevance" score (0-1) indicating the degree to which the gene's known functions relate to maintaining resting state; and a set of evidence snippets (brief quotes or paraphrases with source citations) supporting the main claims.

Once functional summaries have been generated and verified for all genes, these text-based summaries must be converted into vector representations suitable for computing pairwise semantic similarity. This conversion is accomplished using a biomedical-specialized text encoder, such as those derived from BioBERT, SciBERT, or domain-adapted versions of general sentence transformers. The choice of encoder is important: general-purpose encoders may not adequately capture the nuances of biomedical terminology, while biomedical-specialized encoders have been pre-trained on large corpora of scientific literature and are better positioned to recognize functional relationships implicit in gene descriptions[2][5]. For each gene, the encoder produces a high-dimensional vector (typically 384 to 1024 dimensions, depending on the model) that captures the semantic content of the full functional summary. Pairwise semantic similarity between genes i and j is then computed as the cosine similarity of their corresponding vectors, producing a score between 0 (completely unrelated) and 1 (identical functional descriptions). This semantic similarity matrix, denoted S_sem, forms one key component of the eventual integrated Function Similarity Score and captures the degree to which pairs of genes participate in similar biological processes, interact with common partners, or serve related roles in T-cell biology.

## Phylogenetic and Evolutionary Relatedness Assessment

Genes that share recent common ancestors and that have maintained similar sequences and domain architectures across species are likely to preserve similar or overlapping functions, even if they have diverged in expression pattern or regulation. This evolutionary principle underlies the use of phylogenetic information as a proxy for functional relatedness and is particularly valuable in eukaryotic systems, where gene families have expanded through tandem and whole-genome duplication events, and where orthology and paralogy relationships can be systematically inferred and catalogued[3][6]. Rather than computing true phylogenetic relationships (which apply to individual gene sequences), the proposed strategy constructs a knowledge-based "relatedness tree" and matrix that reflects gene family membership, orthology/paralogy relationships, and sequence divergence, thereby capturing the evolutionary context that constrains or enables functional divergence.

The construction of a phylogenetic/evolutionary relatedness representation begins with systematic retrieval of gene family and orthogroup annotations from multiple authoritative sources. Ensembl Comparative Genomics (Ensembl Compara) provides high-quality orthology and paralogy calls based on sequence similarity and synteny; each gene is assigned to an orthogroup and is linked to its orthologs in other species and its paralogs within the mouse genome. UniProt protein family classifications (UniProtKB/families) group proteins into hierarchical families based on homology and functional similarity. Pfam clan and family annotations describe shared protein domain architectures and allow genes encoding proteins with similar modular structures to be identified. OMA (Orthologous MAtrix) provides an independent database of orthology relationships inferred using a sensitive pairwise method and is useful for cross-validation. By aggregating these diverse sources, one constructs a comprehensive map of gene family relationships for the analysis set[6].

Given the family and orthology assignments, the next step is to construct a hierarchical tree or dendrogram that reflects evolutionary relationships among genes. This tree can be built using several approaches: (1) agglomerative hierarchical clustering based on a distance metric that incorporates shared family membership, number of orthologs in other species, and sequence divergence (computed from orthology databases); (2) a formal phylogenetic reconstruction if sequences can be aligned, using methods like neighbor-joining or maximum likelihood; or (3) a knowledge-based construction in which genes are positioned on the tree according to their family-level organization and divergence times inferred from species phylogenies. For the purposes of the present analysis, approach (3) is most practical: genes within the same orthogroup are clustered together; paralogs (products of in-species duplications) are positioned at distances reflecting their sequence divergence; and orthologs to genes in other species inform branch lengths and topology[3][6]. The resulting dendrogram is a tree whose leaves represent the genes under study and whose internal nodes represent ancestral genes or family origins.

From this phylogenetic tree, one computes a pairwise cophenetic distance matrix—a measure of the distance between any two genes as determined by their position in the tree. Specifically, the cophenetic distance between genes i and j is the height of the lowest common ancestor node in the dendrogram; genes that share a more recent common ancestor have smaller cophenetic distances. This distance is then normalized to a similarity score, S_phy(i,j), by applying a standard transformation such as S_phy = exp(-distance/scale), where scale is chosen such that the resulting scores span the range 0 to 1, with scores near 1 for very closely related genes (e.g., recent paralogs or orthologs) and scores near 0 for distantly related genes. An alternative approach, particularly suitable if family-level information is sparse, is to compute a discrete measure of phylogenetic similarity based on shared family/clan membership (e.g., Jaccard similarity of family annotations), though this loses information about sequence divergence.

A crucial aspect of this step is the explicit avoidance of using the LLM to "invent" evolutionary relationships or phylogenetic inferences. Rather, the LLM's role is limited to retrieving, normalizing, and reconciling family and orthology information from multiple databases, resolving ambiguities where different databases provide conflicting assignments, and annotating the final tree with biological interpretation (e.g., noting that a particular branch represents an expansion of cytokine receptor genes in mammals). All numerical relationships (distances, similarities) must be derived from the underlying data (sequence comparisons, family databases) rather than from LLM-generated text. This ensures that the phylogenetic component of the analysis remains grounded in well-established comparative genomics principles and prevents the introduction of speculative or unfounded evolutionary claims.

The result of this phase is a phylogenetic similarity matrix, S_phy, that quantifies the evolutionary relatedness of all gene pairs based on family membership, orthology/paralogy structure, and estimated sequence divergence. This matrix serves as one input to the eventual integrated similarity scoring system and provides a principled way to incorporate evolutionary information into the identification of functionally related gene pairs. Genes with high phylogenetic similarity are expected to have retained similar functional roles (though they may be expressed in different cell types or contexts), making them candidates for co-regulatory relationships or participation in common pathways.

## Expression-Based Similarity Quantification

The transcriptomic expression profiles across the diverse T-cell states represented in the input dataset provide a window into the co-regulation of genes and, by extension, into their functional relationships. Genes that are co-expressed—that show correlated variation in expression levels across conditions and cell types—are often engaged in common biological processes, participate in the same regulatory networks, or respond to shared environmental or developmental signals[1][4]. The computation of robust expression-based similarity is central to the proposed analysis and requires careful attention to the specific conditions and subsets of cells or samples being analyzed.

The primary metric for expression-based similarity is the Pearson correlation coefficient computed on log-transformed TPM values. For each pair of genes, the Pearson correlation is calculated across all available samples, producing a single coefficient that ranges from -1 (perfect inverse correlation) to +1 (perfect positive correlation). This global correlation matrix, denoted r_global, captures the overall co-expression tendency of each gene pair across the full diversity of T-cell states (resting naive, resting memory, activated TH subsets, and time-course samples). However, because this analysis is specifically motivated by understanding resting T-cell regulation, an additional resting-specific correlation matrix, denoted r_resting, should be computed using only samples from naive and memory T-cell populations. This resting-focused matrix captures gene pairs whose co-regulation is specific to or strongest in quiescent cells, which may differ from globally co-expressed pairs. For example, a gene involved in maintaining quiescence may show positive correlation with a memory-specific transcription factor in the resting matrix but may be negatively correlated in the global matrix if it is suppressed upon activation. Stratification by CD4 versus CD8 lineage is also informative; computing separate matrices for CD4-resting and CD8-resting enables the identification of quiescence-maintenance genes that may be particularly important in one lineage.

To ensure robustness, the Spearman rank correlation coefficient should also be computed as a non-parametric alternative to Pearson correlation. Spearman correlation is less sensitive to outliers and extreme values and does not assume a linear relationship between expression levels. Comparing results across Pearson and Spearman correlations helps identify gene pairs whose relationship is driven by a few extreme values (suggesting potential artifacts) versus those with consistent monotonic associations (suggesting genuine functional linkage)[1][4]. Genes for which Pearson and Spearman correlations agree are more likely to have biologically meaningful relationships.

Beyond simple pairwise correlation, more sophisticated network-based approaches can reveal hidden functional relationships. Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) is a method that constructs a weighted gene co-expression network, identifies modules of highly interconnected genes, and quantifies the topological overlap of each pair of genes within the network[1]. The topological overlap measure (TOM) reflects not only the direct correlation between two genes but also their shared connections to other genes in the network. This network-aware perspective can reveal genes that are not directly correlated but that are functionally related through shared interactions with hub genes or common module membership. Computing a similarity matrix based on TOM provides an expression-based similarity metric that incorporates higher-order network structure and is often more interpretable from a biological standpoint than simple correlation.

For studies incorporating time-course activated samples (e.g., the 0.5, 1, 2, 4 hour samples mentioned in the problem statement), an additional dimension of expression similarity can be extracted: dynamic similarity. Rather than treating each time point as an independent sample, the time-course trajectory of each gene—i.e., its pattern of expression change from baseline through the time points—can be compared to identify genes with similar temporal dynamics. This can be accomplished using metrics such as the Euclidean distance on mean-centered and normalized time-course vectors, dynamic time warping (DTW) distance (which allows for temporal misalignment and stretching of the trajectory), or Kendall's tau correlation on time-series ranks. Genes with similar temporal dynamics during activation are likely to be co-regulated by common transcriptional or post-transcriptional mechanisms and may constitute a functional module triggered by activation[1].

The result of the expression-based similarity quantification phase is a suite of similarity matrices: S_expr (global), S_expr_resting (resting-specific), S_expr_CD4 and S_expr_CD8 (lineage-specific), S_tom (network-based topological overlap), and optionally S_dynamic (temporal similarity for time-course samples). To integrate these into a single expression-based component for the overall similarity score, a weighted average or a dimensionality reduction technique (e.g., principal component analysis on the set of pairwise correlations) can be used. Alternatively, the different matrices can be retained separately and examined in sensitivity analyses to assess which aspects of expression behavior are most informative for identifying resting T-cell regulatory gene pairs.

## Multi-Modal Integration and Function Similarity Scoring

The convergence of evidence across multiple independent data modalities—functional annotation, evolutionary relatedness, and expression correlation—dramatically increases confidence in inferred functional relationships and provides a principled framework for prioritizing candidate gene pairs for experimental validation. The challenge in multi-modal integration is to devise a method that appropriately weights the contributions of each modality, accounts for potential redundancy or disagreement among modalities, and produces an easily interpretable score.

A straightforward approach to multi-modal integration is a weighted linear combination of normalized similarity scores from each modality[5]. Specifically, for each gene pair (i, j), the integrated Function Similarity Score is computed as:

\[ S_{total}(i,j) = w_1 \cdot S_{expr}(i,j) + w_2 \cdot S_{sem}(i,j) + w_3 \cdot S_{phy}(i,j) \]

where S_expr, S_sem, and S_phy are the expression-based, semantic, and phylogenetic similarity scores, respectively, each normalized to the range [0, 1], and w_1, w_2, w_3 are non-negative weights summing to 1. This formulation allows each modality to contribute proportionally to the final similarity assessment. The choice of weights can be informed by several considerations: (1) prior beliefs about the relative informativeness of each modality (e.g., one might assign higher weight to expression similarity if the goal is to identify co-regulated genes in a specific tissue or condition); (2) a weak-supervision framework in which known functional relationships (e.g., genes in the same canonical pathway, as defined by Reactome or KEGG) are treated as positive examples, and weights are optimized to maximize the agreement between S_total scores and these ground-truth relationships; or (3) an empirical validation approach in which weights are systematically varied, and the resulting gene pair rankings are assessed by comparison to literature or experimental evidence.

Before choosing weights, it is essential to examine the correlation structure among the component similarity scores. If two modalities are highly correlated with each other (e.g., if genes with similar functions invariably have similar sequences and thus high phylogenetic similarity), then including both modalities without downweighting their combined contribution risks inflating the effective weight of the redundant information. Conversely, if modalities are largely uncorrelated, then each contributes independent information and can be given substantial weight. Computing the Pearson correlation between all pairs of component similarity scores (treating each gene pair as an observation) quantifies this redundancy and informs weight selection.

A more sophisticated integration approach employs machine learning to learn optimal weights or to combine modalities in a non-linear fashion. For instance, a logistic regression model can be trained on a set of gene pairs with known functional relationships (defined, e.g., as pairs participating in the same canonical pathway or pairs with known protein-protein interactions), with the component similarities as features and binary labels (functionally related or unrelated) as targets. The learned coefficients (weights) of this logistic regression reflect the relative importance of each modality for predicting functional relatedness in the specific context of interest. Similarly, methods such as gradient boosted trees can capture non-linear interactions among modalities and may be more flexible than linear models. Importantly, any such learning-based approach must use knowledge external to the input dataset (e.g., canonical pathways from Reactome, protein interactions from curated databases) to avoid circular reasoning.

A particularly valuable approach for T-cell biology is to incorporate domain knowledge by weighting the modalities differently for different gene pairs or biological contexts. For example, genes involved in metabolic remodeling (such as mTOR and glycolytic enzymes) may show strong expression-based similarity in activated T cells but low phylogenetic similarity (if they belong to different protein families); here, high weight on expression similarity may be appropriate. In contrast, co-receptors or adaptor proteins may have high phylogenetic similarity (if they are paralogs) but variable expression correlation (if one is predominantly CD4-expressed and another CD8-expressed); here, higher weight on phylogenetic similarity might be justified. This context-specific weighting can be implemented by first identifying the biological context or functional class of each gene pair (using the LLM-generated annotations or manual classification) and then applying modality-specific weights for each context.

After computing S_total for all gene pairs, a rank-normalization step ensures that the final scores are calibrated and comparable across modalities. Rank normalization—converting each score to its percentile rank (0-100) within the distribution of all pairwise scores—is a robust transformation that reduces the influence of outliers and makes scores interpretable as percentiles. This normalization is particularly useful if the component modalities have been computed using different software, have been stored in different units, or have substantially different variance.

## Identification of Gene Pairs Critical for Resting T-Cell Regulation

The ultimate goal of the similarity scoring exercise is to identify gene pairs that are most likely to function together in regulating and maintaining T-cell quiescence (the resting state of naive and memory T cells). This identification step combines the integrated Function Similarity Score with explicit criteria for selecting genes that are preferentially involved in quiescence maintenance.

Resting T cells are characterized by low activation of proliferative, effector, and metabolic pathways; sustained expression of quiescence markers such as TCF7 (T-cell factor 7), LEF1 (lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1), and IL7R (interleukin-7 receptor); and specialized metabolic states (high oxidative phosphorylation, low glycolysis) distinct from activated cells. Genes preferentially expressed in or selective for resting T cells are candidates for resting-state regulation[4]. To identify such genes, the analysis should compute condition-specific measures of resting association: (1) mean expression level in resting (naive + memory) samples relative to activated samples (e.g., log fold-change or effect size); (2) AUROC (area under the receiver-operator-characteristic curve) statistic, which quantifies the discriminative ability of each gene's expression in distinguishing resting from activated cells; (3) the fraction of resting samples with above-median expression of the gene; and (4) correlation with known resting/quiescence markers (such as TCF7, IL7R, and CCR7 in memory cells).

Gene pairs meeting the subsequent criteria are prioritized for biological interpretation and experimental validation: (1) both genes in the pair have high individual resting-association scores (e.g., log fold-change > 1, AUROC > 0.7); (2) the integrated Function Similarity Score S_total is above a threshold (e.g., top 5th percentile, or S_total > 0.6 if scores are scaled 0-1); (3) the semantic and/or phylogenetic components of the similarity score suggest a mechanistically plausible relationship (e.g., one gene encodes a transcription factor and the other a target gene based on annotation; or both genes belong to the same KEGG pathway); and (4) at least one pair-specific piece of supporting evidence is available, such as known protein-protein interaction, shared pathway membership, or complementary roles in a known regulatory axis.

Additionally, some resting-relevant gene pairs may not meet the criterion of high resting expression but instead may be distinguished by strong suppression upon activation or by inverse relationship with activation markers. For example, inhibitory or negative-feedback genes that are normally expressed in resting cells but rapidly suppressed upon stimulation might show negative correlation with activation markers but high correlation with quiescence markers. These pairs can be identified by examining the expression-based similarity computed specifically on resting samples (r_resting) versus the global correlation (r_global); pairs with strong positive r_resting but near-zero or negative r_global may represent resting-specific co-regulation that is disrupted upon activation.

For each candidate gene pair meeting selection criteria, a detailed evidence report should be compiled, including: (1) the individual Function Similarity Score and its component scores (S_expr, S_sem, S_phy); (2) the resting-association score for each gene (log fold-change, AUROC); (3) key phrases from the LLM-generated functional summaries that support a mechanistic relationship; (4) any evidence of known protein-protein interaction or pathway co-membership; (5) the expression pattern across resting and activated cell types (e.g., mean expression in CD4-naive, CD8-naive, CD4-memory, CD8-memory, and activated subsets); and (6) known or predicted roles in T-cell quiescence, memory maintenance, or resistance to activation. These reports can be formatted as a structured table or as brief narratives and serve as the primary deliverable of this phase of the analysis.

## Protein Structure and Domain-Based Similarity Analysis

For the subset of genes most strongly associated with resting T-cell function—specifically, the top 300 genes by mean (or median) expression level within resting T-cell samples—an additional layer of analysis incorporates protein structure and domain information. This structural perspective complements the expression and functional approaches by identifying genes encoding proteins with similar architectural features, which often indicates shared molecular mechanisms or evolutionary conservation of binding interfaces and catalytic strategies.

The initial step in structure-based analysis is the systematic retrieval of protein structure and domain information for the top 300 resting-expressed genes. This retrieval should target multiple public resources: (1) the Pfam database, which assigns each protein to conserved protein domain families and organizations; (2) InterProScan or similar resources, which integrate information from multiple domain databases (Pfam, SMART, PROSITE) into a unified annotation; (3) the Protein Data Bank (PDB), which houses experimentally determined three-dimensional structures of proteins; and (4) the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database (AlphaFoldDB), which provides high-confidence predicted structures for virtually all proteins in major organisms, generated using the AlphaFold2 algorithm[1][4]. For each protein, the resulting annotations include an ordered list of domains (with their boundaries in the protein sequence), descriptions of each domain's function, experimental structures if available (with quality metrics such as resolution), and AlphaFold-predicted structures with per-residue confidence scores.

Domain-based similarity between proteins is computed by comparing the architecture of their domain compositions. One standard approach is the Jaccard similarity of domain sets: if protein i contains domains {D1, D2, D3} and protein j contains domains {D2, D3, D4}, then Jaccard similarity is 2 / 4 = 0.5 (the size of the intersection divided by the size of the union). This metric is simple and interpretable but loses information about domain order and orientation. A more sophisticated approach is sequence-based comparison of domain architectures: the ordered domain sequence is treated as a string (e.g., "Pkinase-Pkinase_Tyr-Pkinase_Tyr_II"), and pairwise similarities are computed using string edit distance or other sequence-alignment metrics adapted for domain sequences[3]. Proteins with similar domain architectures are more likely to have conserved binding interfaces and catalytic mechanisms and may thus have overlapping functional roles.

For structure-based similarity, the ideal data are experimentally determined three-dimensional structures from the PDB. However, these are available for only a fraction of proteins; for the remainder, AlphaFold-predicted structures provide high-quality alternatives. When structures are available, computationally efficient structural alignment tools such as Foldseek can be used to compare all pairs of structures and compute structural similarity scores (e.g., TM-score, which ranges from 0 to 1 with scores > 0.5 generally indicating similar folds). The Foldseek algorithm is particularly valuable because it scales well to large numbers of structure comparisons and uses a sequence-independent representation based on local structure geometry[1][4]. For more refined structural comparisons, dedicated structure alignment tools such as TM-align or PyMOL can be used, though these are slower and are best applied to a curated subset of gene pairs with strong prior evidence of functional similarity.

The structural similarity scores are aggregated into a similarity matrix, S_struct, indexed by gene pairs. This matrix can be combined with the previously computed similarity scores (S_expr, S_sem, S_phy) by incorporating it into an expanded integrated similarity formula:

\[ S_{total2}(i,j) = w_1 \cdot S_{expr}(i,j) + w_2 \cdot S_{sem}(i,j) + w_3 \cdot S_{phy}(i,j) + w_4 \cdot S_{struct}(i,j) \]

where weights are re-normalized such that they sum to 1. Alternatively, S_struct can be retained as an independent filtering criterion, used to rank pairs among those already identified as high-confidence by other modalities, or serve as a tie-breaker when multiple gene pairs have similar S_total scores.

Given the heightened interest in resting T-cell biology and the specific expression focus on the top 300 genes, additional structure-specific analyses can provide biological insight. For example, genes encoding proteins with similar structural folds (as determined by Foldseek or other methods) can be grouped into structural families, and the enrichment of known functional annotations within each structural family can be assessed. This enrichment analysis may reveal families of structurally similar proteins that partition into distinct functional subgroups, suggesting that structural similarity alone is insufficient to predict function without additional information. Conversely, if structural families are functionally homogeneous, this indicates strong conservation of molecular mechanism and can guide functional predictions for less well-characterized members.

Furthermore, the structural analysis can be focused on specific protein classes highly relevant to T-cell quiescence, such as transcription factors (which often share DNA-binding domains but differ in regulatory domains and protein-interaction surfaces), signaling molecules (including kinases, phosphatases, and adaptor proteins), and lymphokine/cytokine receptors. For transcription factors, additional structure-specific features such as the sequence and spacing of zinc fingers, helix-turn-helix motifs, and other DNA-binding domains can be extracted from the Pfam annotations and used to compute more granular similarity scores specific to DNA-binding properties. For signaling molecules, kinase domain similarity (computed at the sequence level or by structural alignment) can identify kinase pairs with potentially similar substrate specificities. These class-specific analyses can uncover gene pairs that are similar in their regulatory mechanisms or functions but may not have been captured by global similarity metrics.

## Quality Control, Validation, and Interpretation Framework

The identification of gene pairs involved in resting T-cell regulation is only credible if supported by robust quality control measures and validation against independent evidence. This section outlines a comprehensive framework for assessing the reliability of the proposed gene pairs and for interpreting the results in a biologically meaningful way.

### Sanity Checks and Known Relationship Validation

As an initial sanity check, the analysis should verify that known co-regulatory gene pairs and functional relationships score highly under the proposed integration scheme. For example, genes involved in T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling—such as CD3D, CD3E, ZAP70, LCK, LAG3, and PD1—should mutually score high on similarity, particularly on semantic and phylogenetic axes. Similarly, memory T-cell markers such as IL7R, CCR7, and TCF7 should exhibit high co-expression and semantic similarity when restricted to the resting subset. Conversely, genes that are known to have distinct functions or that are expressed in different T-cell subsets (e.g., IFNg, a hallmark of TH1 and CTL cells, versus IL4, a hallmark of TH2 cells) should score lower on expression similarity, though they may still have moderate semantic similarity if both are considered "effector" genes. Systematic comparison of the proposed gene pair rankings to curated databases of known functional relationships—such as those in GO, KEGG, Reactome, and BioGRID (a database of protein and genetic interactions)—provides a quantitative assessment of the method's validity[1][2][5]. A contingency table or ROC curve analysis can quantify the sensitivity and specificity of the method in recovering known relationships.

### Sensitivity and Robustness Analyses

To assess the stability and generalizability of the identified gene pairs, a comprehensive sensitivity analysis should be performed. Key aspects of sensitivity analysis include: (1) comparing results obtained using Pearson versus Spearman correlation (and other robust variants such as percentage bend correlation) to ensure that identified pairs are not artifacts of outliers or non-linear relationships; (2) computing similarity scores using resting-specific expression versus global expression to assess the degree to which the resting association of gene pairs depends on restricting to resting samples; (3) excluding the phylogenetic and structural modalities in sequence (e.g., computing S_total using only expression and semantic similarity, then only expression and phylogenetic, etc.) to determine which modalities drive the identification of specific gene pairs; (4) re-running the LLM functional summarization using different prompts, different LLM models, or different retrieval databases to assess the stability of semantic similarity scores; (5) varying the weights w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4 within reasonable ranges and assessing whether the top-ranking gene pairs remain stable; and (6) subsampling the input data (e.g., using only CD4 or only CD8 T cells, or leaving out specific activated conditions) to determine whether identified pairs are robust to the specific conditions included in the analysis.

For each sensitivity analysis, the effect on the ranking of gene pairs should be quantified (e.g., by computing the rank correlation of pair rankings under the original versus modified approach using Spearman's rho or Kendall's tau). Pairs that maintain high ranking across multiple sensitivity analyses are more likely to reflect true functional relationships, while pairs whose ranking is highly sensitive to methodological choices may be artifacts and should be deprioritized.

### Biological Interpretation and Mechanistic Plausibility

Beyond numerical scores and rankings, a rigorous interpretation of identified gene pairs requires assessment of their mechanistic plausibility in the context of known T-cell biology. For each top-ranking gene pair, the analysis should address the following questions: (1) Do the genes encode proteins that physically interact, or do they participate in the same pathway or complex? (2) If one gene encodes a transcription factor and the other encodes a target gene, is the target's promoter known or predicted to contain binding sites for the transcription factor? (3) Are the genes co-localized to the same subcellular compartment, suggesting potential functional interactions? (4) Do the genes show evidence of co-regulation at the transcriptional level (e.g., sharing cis-regulatory elements) or at the post-transcriptional level (e.g., both regulated by the same microRNA)? (5) Is there experimental evidence (from the literature, from external databases, or from prior studies on the same dataset) that manipulating one gene (e.g., by knockout, knockdown, or overexpression) affects the expression or function of the other?

Addressing these questions often requires consulting external databases and literature. Key resources include: (1) STRING (Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes), which aggregates known and predicted protein-protein interactions; (2) transcription factor target databases such as JASPAR (for predicted targets based on transcription factor binding site motifs) or ChIP-seq databases (for experimentally determined targets); (3) pathway databases including Reactome, KEGG, and Wikipathways, which encode known mechanistic relationships; (4) disease or phenotype databases such as ClinVar and the Human Phenotype Ontology, which may reveal roles of gene pairs in specific disease processes; and (5) primary literature via PubMed or Google Scholar.

For genes not previously characterized, computational approaches can generate mechanistic hypotheses. For example, if an uncharacterized gene shares a high-similarity protein domain with a known transcription factor, it may also bind DNA or regulate transcription. If a gene is co-expressed with known cytokine receptors and co-signals, it may participate in signal transduction. The LLM-generated functional summaries, if properly verified against the literature, may also suggest mechanistic roles that can be evaluated further.

### Visualization and Communication of Results

A crucial component of the quality control and interpretation framework is the creation of clear, informative visualizations that communicate the evidence for identified gene pairs to scientific colleagues and stakeholders. Recommended visualizations include: (1) a heatmap showing the component similarity scores (S_expr, S_sem, S_phy, S_struct) for the top 50 or 100 gene pairs, with rows corresponding to gene pairs and columns to similarity modalities, allowing patterns in which modalities drive particular pairs to be easily discerned; (2) a scatter plot with S_expr on one axis and S_sem on another, with genes colored by resting-association score or by known functional category, enabling simultaneous evaluation of multiple modalities; (3) a network diagram in which nodes represent genes and edges connect gene pairs with high integrated similarity, with node color indicating resting-association score and edge thickness indicating S_total score; (4) a bar plot or forest plot showing the effect sizes (log fold-change, AUROC) and confidence intervals for resting-association scores of genes in top pairs; and (5) expression profiles (violin plots, dot plots, or heatmaps) showing expression of top gene pairs across resting and activated conditions, with clear visual separation of CD4 and CD8 subsets if available.

These visualizations serve multiple purposes: they enable rapid appraisal of the overall quality and coherence of results; they facilitate communication with domain experts who can provide feedback on biological plausibility; and they provide transparency regarding the evidence underlying each conclusion, supporting reproducibility and external validation.

## Conclusion

The integrated multi-modal strategy presented in this report provides a comprehensive, implementation-ready framework for systematically identifying gene pairs that regulate T-cell quiescence and maintain resting states in naive and memory T cells. By synthesizing large language models with phylogenetic comparative methods, expression correlation analysis, and protein structure prediction, the proposed pipeline leverages multiple independent lines of evidence to construct robust, well-supported hypotheses about T-cell gene regulation.

The key innovations of this approach are: (1) the explicit use of LLMs with retrieval-augmented generation and self-verification to synthesize distributed biological knowledge into actionable gene function summaries; (2) the integration of evolutionary relationships through knowledge-based phylogenetic relatedness rather than sequence-level phylogenetics, which is more practical and interpretable in a genomics context; (3) the multi-modal integration of expression, semantic, phylogenetic, and structural information into a single Function Similarity Score, weighted to balance the contributions of each modality; and (4) the explicit stratification and analysis of resting T-cell populations, enabling the identification of quiescence-specific regulatory relationships that would be obscured in global analyses.

The analysis strategy is designed to be robust, transparent, and practically executable using widely available tools and data sources. The emphasis on quality control, sensitivity analysis, and validation against known relationships ensures that conclusions are credible and actionable. Future applications of this framework could extend it to other cell types and biological states, incorporate additional modalities such as epigenomic data (histone modifications, open chromatin), or leverage emerging knowledge from single-cell multi-omic studies that directly measure combinations of transcriptomics, proteomics, and accessibility data in individual cells.

By following this strategy, researchers can move beyond descriptive characterization of T-cell transcriptomes toward mechanistic understanding of the gene regulatory networks that maintain T-cell identity, enable rapid responses to pathogens, and sustain protective immunity across the lifetime of the organism. The identified gene pairs constitute high-confidence candidates for experimental validation (e.g., via CRISPR-Cas9 genetic screens, immunoaffinity pulldowns, or chromatin immunoprecipitation) and for the development of therapeutic strategies targeting dysregulated quiescence or inappropriate activation in disease states such as autoimmunity and cancer.
