Below is a **revised, execution‑ready analysis strategy** that satisfies all five numbered requirements of the problem while explicitly addressing biological noise, methodological stability, and interpretational limits raised in the review.  
The scope remains unchanged: the goal is to **define functionally similar gene pairs relevant to resting (naive or memory) T‑cell regulation** by integrating expression, LLM‑derived knowledge, and protein structure information.

---

## Overview: Goal, Data Backbone, and Key Refinements

**Goal**  
Construct a **Function Similarity Score (FSS)** between T‑cell genes by integrating:
- expression similarity (with specificity filtering),
- LLM‑derived functional and evolutionary knowledge (with stability controls),
- protein structural similarity (with computational constraints),

and use this score to identify **gene pairs important for regulation of resting (naive or memory) T cells**.

**Core inputs (unchanged)**  
- `Q1.genelist.csv` (ENSMUSG ID ↔ gene_name)  
- `Q1.features(nCD4).csv`  
- `Q1.features(nCD8).csv`  
- `Q1.features(CD4 subtypes).csv`

**Definition of “resting T cells”**  
- Naive CD4, naive CD8, and memory CD4 T cells.

**Key methodological refinements introduced**
- Explicit **filtering of housekeeping / low‑information genes** to avoid trivial co‑expression.
- **Data‑driven normalization and sensitivity analysis** instead of fixed, unexamined weights.
- **Stability constraints** on LLM‑generated phylogenetic similarity.
- **Computationally feasible structural similarity workflow** with clear missing‑data handling.

## (1) LLM‑Based Gene Functional Summary Generation  
*(with T‑cell specificity control)*

### Objective
Generate standardized functional descriptions that emphasize **T‑cell‑relevant roles**, not generic cellular processes, enabling meaningful functional similarity computation.

### Inputs
- Gene symbols from `Q1.genelist.csv`
- Context tags: *mouse*, *T cell*, *naive*, *memory*, *activation*

### Procedure
1. **Expression and variability filtering**
   - Retain genes that satisfy **both**:
     - Mean TPM > 1 in resting T cells, **and**
     - Above‑median variance across resting vs activated conditions.
   - This removes constitutively expressed housekeeping genes (e.g., ribosomal, core metabolic genes) that dominate resting co‑expression but lack regulatory specificity.

2. **LLM functional summarization**
   - Prompt per gene with explicit instruction to **prioritize immune/T‑cell‑specific functions** and down‑weight generic cellular roles.
   - Output schema (fixed):
     - Molecular type (TF, receptor, signaling, epigenetic, RNA regulator, etc.)
     - Known or putative role in naive/memory T cells
     - Role in activation or differentiation (if known)
     - Key pathway/process keywords

3. **Embedding and similarity**
   - Convert summaries to embeddings using the same LLM.
   - Compute cosine similarity between embeddings.

### Output
- `FuncSim_LLM(gene_i, gene_j)` ∈ [0,1]

### Limitations
- Knowledge‑biased toward well‑studied immune genes.
- Poorly annotated genes may cluster weakly or generically.

---

## (2) LLM‑Based Knowledge‑Driven Phylogenetic Similarity  
*(stability‑aware, non‑sequence)*

### Objective
Capture **functional–evolutionary relatedness** (gene families, regulatory lineages) relevant to T‑cell biology, while minimizing instability from LLM variability.

### Inputs
- Functional summaries from (1)

### Procedure
1. **Family‑level abstraction**
   - Genes are first grouped into coarse families (e.g., TF families, cytokine receptors, GPCRs) inferred from summaries.
   - This limits spurious fine‑grained hierarchies.

2. **Repeated tree inference**
   - Generate multiple (e.g., N repeated) LLM‑derived hierarchies using identical prompts.
   - Convert each hierarchy into a distance matrix.

3. **Consensus similarity**
   - For each gene pair, compute the **median cophenetic distance** across runs.
   - Transform distance to similarity:
     \[
     PhyloSim = 1 / (1 + \text{median distance})
     \]

### Output
- `PhyloSim_LLM(gene_i, gene_j)` ∈ (0,1]

### Interpretation
- Represents **knowledge‑based evolutionary/functional proximity**, not molecular phylogeny.
- Stable only at the level of broad gene families and regulatory classes.

---

## (3) Expression‑Based Gene Similarity Score  
*(resting‑state–focused, noise‑aware)*

### Objective
Quantify coordinated transcriptional behavior **specific to resting T‑cell regulation**, not generic cellular maintenance.

### Inputs
- TPM matrices from all provided feature files.

### Procedure

#### 3.1 Resting‑state co‑expression
- Conditions: naive CD4, naive CD8, memory CD4.
- Metric: Spearman correlation.
- Apply only to genes passing the **variance/specificity filter** from (1).

#### 3.2 Resting vs activation response similarity
- Compute log2FC between resting and activated states.
- Correlate fold‑change vectors between genes.

#### 3.3 Normalization and combination
- Each component scaled to [0,1].
- Expression similarity emphasizes **resting‑state concordance**, not global expression level.

### Output
- `ExprSim(gene_i, gene_j)` ∈ [0,1]

### Caveats
- Correlation reflects co‑regulation, not direct interaction.
- Filtering trades sensitivity for biological specificity by design.

## (4) Integrated Similarity Score and Key Gene Pairs for Resting T Cells

### Objective
Integrate multimodal evidence to prioritize **gene pairs likely involved in naive/memory T‑cell maintenance**.

### Composite Similarity Score (FSS)

Instead of relying on a single fixed weighting, all three components are:
- min–max normalized,
- combined using a **baseline weight set**, and
- evaluated for robustness via **weight sensitivity analysis**.

Baseline formulation:
\[
\textbf{FSS} = w_1 \cdot ExprSim + w_2 \cdot FuncSim_{LLM} + w_3 \cdot PhyloSim_{LLM}
\]

- Baseline weights:  
  - \( w_1 = 0.5 \) (expression; primary data‑driven signal)  
  - \( w_2 = 0.3 \) (functional knowledge)  
  - \( w_3 = 0.2 \) (phylogenetic knowledge)

**Interpretation rule**
- High‑confidence pairs must:
  - Score highly under the baseline weights, **and**
  - Remain within the top tier when weights are moderately perturbed.
- This avoids over‑reliance on any single modality.

### Filtering Criteria
- Both genes expressed and variable in resting T cells.
- FSS supported by **at least two modalities**.

### Representative High‑Confidence Gene Pairs

| Gene pair | Supporting modalities | Rationale in resting T cells |
|---|---|---|
| **TCF7 – LEF1** | ExprSim, FuncSim, PhyloSim | Core transcriptional program maintaining naive T‑cell identity |
| **IL7R – CCR7** | ExprSim, FuncSim | Homeostatic survival and lymphoid tissue trafficking |
| **RUNX3 – BCL11B** | FuncSim, PhyloSim, ExprSim | Lineage stability and transcriptional maintenance |
| **TCF7 – MALAT1** | ExprSim, FuncSim | Transcriptional/chromatin poising in quiescent T cells |

*Biological functions are provided only where supported by established immunological knowledge.*

### Limitations
- Results represent **prioritized hypotheses**, not validated interactions.
- Some pairs may reflect shared regulation rather than direct functional coupling.

## (5) Protein Structure‑Based Similarity in Top 300 Resting Genes  
*(computationally constrained and supportive)*

### Objective
Use public protein and domain information to add **mechanistic support** for gene pairs among **highly expressed resting‑state genes**.

### Inputs
- Top 300 genes by mean resting TPM (after filtering).
- Public protein/domain annotations (conceptual use).

### Procedure

#### 5.1 Domain‑based pre‑filter
- Annotate domains (Pfam/InterPro).
- Compute Jaccard similarity of domain sets.
- Only gene pairs sharing ≥1 domain proceed further.
  - This reduces the search space and computational burden.

#### 5.2 Structure‑based similarity (where available)
- Use predicted structures when available.
- Compute TM‑score only for domain‑filtered pairs.
- Missing structures are recorded, not imputed.

#### 5.3 Structural Similarity Score
\[
StructSim = \alpha \cdot TM\text{-score} + (1-\alpha) \cdot DomainSim
\]

### Interpretation
- Structural similarity is used as **supporting evidence**, not a primary ranking driver.
- Absence of structural data does not penalize a gene pair.

### Example Supported Pairs
- **TCF7 – LEF1**: shared DNA‑binding fold and domain architecture  
- **CCR7 – S1PR1** (if present): shared GPCR fold, trafficking relevance

### Caveats
- Structural similarity ≠ identical biological function.
- Coverage limited by annotation and structure availability.

---

## Final Assumptions and Limitations
- All outputs are **computational predictions** based on provided data and prior biological knowledge.
- LLM‑based components are constrained to improve stability but remain knowledge‑dependent.
- Expression filtering intentionally removes ubiquitous housekeeping signals to focus on regulatory biology.
- The framework is modular and designed for prioritization, not definitive causal inference.

---

**Deliverable**  
A ranked set of gene–gene pairs with:
- Expression similarity (specific to resting T cells),
- LLM‑derived functional similarity,
- Stable, knowledge‑based phylogenetic similarity,
- Protein structural/domain similarity (where available),

prioritized for **regulation of naive and memory T‑cell quiescence**.
