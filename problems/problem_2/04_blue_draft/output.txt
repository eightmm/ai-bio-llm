Below is a **single, coherent answer that exactly follows the numbering and scope requested in the Problem**.  
Because the provided **Data analysis output reports that the files could not be resolved**, **no empirical numerical results are asserted**.

## (1) Possible molecular mechanisms by which the viral CRE increases RNA stability, and how to test them

### Hypothesis 1: CRE-mediated recruitment of poly(A)-binding proteins and mRNA circularization
**Mechanism**  
The CRE in the 3′ UTR promotes binding of host RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), such as PABPC or stabilizing ARE-binding proteins (e.g., HuR), enhancing mRNA circularization (5′ cap–eIF4G–PABPC–poly(A)) and shielding the poly(A) tail from deadenylases.

**Validation**
- **RIP-seq / CLIP-seq** targeting PABPC, HuR, ELAVL-family proteins  
  *Input:* active-cre vs. active-control RNA  
  *Output:* enrichment of CRE-containing reads  
- **CRE mutagenesis** followed by mRNA half-life measurement (actinomycin D chase)  
- **Polysome profiling** to test coupling of stabilization to translation

---

### Hypothesis 2: CRE-dependent modification of the poly(A) tail with non-A nucleotides
**Mechanism**  
The CRE recruits non-canonical poly(A) polymerases or terminal nucleotidyl transferases, generating mixed poly(A) tails (A/G/U), which are poor substrates for CCR4–NOT and PAN2–PAN3 deadenylases.

**Validation**
- **Nanopore dRNA-seq tail composition analysis**  
  *Metric:* frequency of non-A bases within poly(A)  
- **Enzyme perturbation** (siRNA or CRISPR knockout of PAPD5, TENT5A, TUTs)  
- **In vitro polyadenylation assays** with CRE-containing RNA substrates

---

### Hypothesis 3: CRE inhibits recruitment or activity of deadenylase complexes
**Mechanism**  
The CRE binds factors that block CCR4–NOT or PAN2–PAN3 access to the poly(A) tail, slowing deadenylation without necessarily altering initial tail length.

**Validation**
- **Deadenylation kinetics assays** using cell extracts  
- **Co-IP / CLIP-seq** for CCR4–NOT subunits  
- **Loss-of-function of inhibitory RBPs** followed by stability assays

---

### Hypothesis 4: CRE-dependent uridylation at intermediate poly(A) tail lengths
**Mechanism**  
Selective uridylation by TUT enzymes at non-terminal stages prevents commitment to rapid decay pathways.

**Validation**
- **Signal-level nanopore analysis** to detect U-rich current signatures  
- **TUT enzyme knockdown** combined with dRNA-seq  
- **Time-course tail analysis** post-transfection

---

## (2) Quantitative comparison of poly(A) tail length distributions using dRNA-seq, and report-style interpretation

### Analysis Pipeline
**Inputs**
- BAM files: `active-control.bam`, `active-cre.bam`, `inactive-control.bam`, `inactive-cre.bam`

**Steps**
1. Extract aligned reads with intact 3′ ends.
2. Estimate poly(A) tail length using:
   - `nanopolish polya` (alignment-based)
   - `tailfindr` (signal-aware)
3. Filter low-quality reads and truncated tails.
4. Generate tail-length distributions per condition.
5. Perform statistical comparisons:
   - Wilcoxon rank-sum test
   - Kolmogorov–Smirnov test
6. Visualize via violin plots and CDFs.

**Outputs**
- Median and IQR of poly(A) length per condition
- Effect sizes and corrected p-values

### Interpretation Framework (for manuscript)
- **Active-cre > Active-control:** supports CRE-mediated stabilization.
- **Active vs. Inactive difference:** indicates host-factor dependency.
- **No difference:** suggests mechanisms independent of tail length.

**Limitation**
- Actual numerical results cannot be reported due to unresolved input files.

## (3) Detection of non-A bases or chemical modifications in poly(A) regions from current signal data

### Analysis Pipeline
**Inputs**
- POD5 files: `*-control.pod5`, `*-cre.pod5`

**Steps**
1. Identify poly(A) regions using alignment coordinates.
2. Extract raw current signals (squiggles).
3. Compare signals to canonical poly(A) current models.
4. Detect deviations using:
   - Tombo / Remora (signal-level statistics)
5. Classify deviations as:
   - Base substitutions (G/U/C)
   - Potential chemical modifications (model-dependent)

**Visualization**
- Signal overlay plots (A vs. non-A)
- Heatmaps of deviation scores along poly(A)

**Caveat**
- Nanopore chemistry cannot unambiguously distinguish all base modifications; results are probabilistic.

## (4) Comparison of non-A base frequency across conditions and biological interpretation

### Quantitative Comparison
**Metrics**
- Fraction of reads with ≥1 non-A base in poly(A)
- Per-base frequency of G, U, C
- Positional density along the tail

**Comparisons**
- active-control vs. active-cre
- active-cre vs. inactive-cre

**Visualization**
- Stacked bar plots (base composition)
- Metagene plots (position vs. frequency)
- Boxplots per condition

### Biological Meaning
- **Higher non-A frequency in active-cre:** CRE recruits tail-modifying enzymes.
- **Absent in inactive cells:** host enzymatic context is required.

### Future Directions
- Link modification patterns to decay resistance kinetics.
- Test whether mixed tails impair deadenylase binding in vitro.

---

## (5) Exploration of unique modification patterns within active-cre poly(A) tails

### Analysis
- Cluster active-cre reads by tail length and modification density.
- Identify hotspots of non-A incorporation.
- Test enrichment near body–tail junction vs. distal tail.

### Hypotheses
- CRE promotes **periodic or clustered modification**, reflecting processive enzyme activity.
- Specific patterns may correspond to distinct enzymes (e.g., G-rich vs. U-rich tails).
