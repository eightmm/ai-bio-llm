## AI‑Driven Mini‑Binder Discovery Pipeline for **Agonistic** TNFR Targeting in TNBC  
*(TNFα–ΔNp63α axis–aligned design)*

**Overall assumption and scope**  
- The objective is **computational discovery and prioritization** of TNFR‑selective **agonistic** mini‑binder candidates that promote TNF signaling consistent with **ΔNp63α degradation** in TNBC.  
- Structural models of TNFR1/2 extracellular domains are available (experimental or AlphaFold‑predicted).  
- All binding and developability properties are **predicted** and used for **relative ranking** only; experimental validation is downstream.  
- Because TNFR signaling requires receptor clustering, **agonist geometry (multivalency/clustering competence)** is explicitly addressed.

### **1. Binder의 TNFR1/2 결합 부위 선정 (Epitope Selection)**

**Objective**  
Select **agonist‑favoring epitopes** on TNFR1 or TNFR2 that promote receptor clustering and downstream TNF signaling, thereby facilitating ΔNp63α degradation.

**Tools / Approaches**  
- Structural analysis of TNFR1/2 extracellular domains (CRD1–CRD4).  
- Mapping of **agonist‑associated epitopes** (non‑ligand‑blocking, clustering‑permissive faces) distinct from TNFα’s steric footprint.  
- Annotation of PLAD‑adjacent and same‑face epitopes known to support receptor multimerization.

**Selection Logic (Agonism‑Aligned)**  
- **Primary intent:** **Agonism**, not antagonism.  
- **TNFR1 vs TNFR2 choice:**  
  - Prioritize the receptor whose activation is most consistent with pro‑degradative TNF signaling in the intended cellular context (explicitly acknowledged as context‑dependent).  
- **Epitope classes:**  
  - Same‑face or PLAD‑adjacent epitopes that **do not block TNFα binding** and are compatible with receptor clustering.  
  - Avoid TNFα‑blocking CRD1–CRD3 epitopes that would suppress signaling.

**Output → Next Step Input**  
- 3–5 **agonist‑compatible epitope definitions** per receptor (residue sets and geometric constraints) to condition generative design.

**Caveat**  
- Epitope–signaling coupling is inferred from structure and prior functional knowledge; cell‑type specificity is not explicitly modeled.

### **2. Binder의 생물물리적 제약 조건 반영 (Biophysical & Architectural Constraints)**

**Objective**  
Design developable mini‑binders while enabling **receptor clustering** required for agonism.

**Design Constraints**  
- **Monomeric unit length:** 40–70 aa (target 50–65 aa).  
- **Topology:** Compact helical or mixed α/β folds with defined cores.  
- **Charge:** Net −5 to +5; pI 5.5–8.5.  
- **Stability:** High predicted fold confidence; optional 1–2 disulfide bonds.  
- **Solubility/Manufacturability:** Avoid aggregation‑prone motifs, cryptic cleavage sites, and unwanted PTM motifs.

**Agonist‑Specific Architectural Constraint**  
- **Multivalency requirement:**  
  - Mini‑binders are designed as **modular units** intended for **dimerization or higher‑order assembly** (e.g., symmetric homodimers, tandem repeats, or fusion to a minimal multimerization motif) to geometrically support TNFR clustering.  
  - The design pipeline evaluates **cluster‑competent assemblies**, not isolated monomers, at the complex‑prediction stage.

**Output → Next Step Input**  
- Scaffold and assembly constraints (monomer + intended oligomeric state) passed to generative models.

**Caveat**  
- Oligomerization behavior is predicted from structure and symmetry assumptions and requires experimental confirmation.

### **3. 후보 binder 서열 설계 (De Novo Sequence Design)**

**Objective**  
Generate sequence‑diverse mini‑binder **modules** compatible with agonist epitopes and multivalent assembly.

**Primary Tools**  
- **RFdiffusion:** Backbone generation conditioned on TNFR epitope geometry and **assembly symmetry**.  
- **ProteinMPNN:** Sequence design with conserved framework and variable paratope residues.

**Procedure**  
1. Generate backbone designs for monomeric units **and** predefined multimeric assemblies.  
2. Filter by fold quality and assembly plausibility.  
3. Generate multiple sequence variants per backbone.  
4. Validate folding confidence of monomers and assemblies using AlphaFold‑based metrics.

**Output → Next Step Input**  
- Candidate sequences with predicted folded **multivalent** structures.

**Alternative Approaches**  
- Rosetta symmetric design workflows for explicit oligomer control.

**Caveat**  
- High folding confidence does not guarantee agonist signaling efficacy.

### **4. 후보 binder–TNFR 결합 구조 및 결합 특성 분석 (Structure & Binding Analysis)**

**Objective**  
Verify intended **agonist binding mode** and estimate **relative affinity** without over‑claiming kinetic precision.

**Tools**  
- **AlphaFold (complex mode):** Predict TNFR–binder **assembly** structures.  
- **Rosetta interface scoring / flex_ddG:** Estimate relative binding free energies (ΔΔG → relative Kd ranking).

**Metrics / Filters**  
- Interface confidence (pAE, pLDDT) at designed epitopes.  
- Favorable relative binding energies across candidates.  
- **Geometric validation of clustering:** Binder orientation and spacing compatible with receptor multimerization.

**Explicit Limitation**  
- **kon/koff are not used as primary ranking metrics.**  
  - Kinetic rates are acknowledged as unreliable to predict accurately for de novo designs without extensive MD or experimental data.  
  - They are excluded from hard filters and, at most, considered qualitatively.

**Output → Next Step Input**  
- Shortlisted candidates with validated agonist‑compatible complex geometries and relative affinity estimates.

### **5. 오프타깃 및 면역원성 평가 (Off‑Target & Immunogenicity Assessment)**

**Objective**  
Minimize unintended receptor engagement and **immunogenicity**, as explicitly required.

**Off‑Target Receptor Assessment**  
- Panel: TNFR superfamily members (Fas, TRAIL‑R1/R2, CD40, OX40, 4‑1BB, etc.).  
- Structure‑based docking and epitope conservation analysis to estimate cross‑reactivity risk.

**Immunogenicity Screening (Explicit Addition)**  
- **MHC‑I and MHC‑II binding prediction** to identify potential T‑cell epitopes.  
- **Epitope density scoring:** Penalize sequences with high‑affinity predicted MHC binders.  
- **Human‑likeness assessment:** Sequence embedding similarity to human proteins to reduce ADA risk.

**Output → Next Step Input**  
- Integrated **off‑target + immunogenicity risk scores** per candidate.

**Caveat**  
- Computational immunogenicity predictions reduce but do not eliminate ADA risk.

### **6. 후보 서열의 우선순위 지표화 (Ranking & Prioritization)**

**Objective**  
Select agonist mini‑binders most likely to promote TNF signaling and ΔNp63α degradation with acceptable safety profiles.

**Ranking Criteria (Weighted, Agonism‑Focused)**  
1. Structural confidence of TNFR–binder **assembly**.  
2. Relative binding affinity (ΔΔG‑based ranking).  
3. **Clustering competence** consistent with agonism.  
4. TNFR1 vs TNFR2 selectivity aligned to intended signaling outcome.  
5. Off‑target receptor risk.  
6. **Immunogenicity risk score** (MHC‑I/II + human‑likeness).  
7. Stability, solubility, and manufacturability indicators.

**Method**  
- Multi‑criteria decision analysis with sensitivity testing on agonism vs safety weights.

**Final Output**  
- Rank‑ordered list of top 10–20 candidates.  
- Selection of 3–5 **agonist‑biased, low‑immunogenicity leads** for experimental validation (binding, clustering, and ΔNp63α degradation assays).

**Limitation**  
- Computational ranking predicts **mechanistic plausibility**, not definitive therapeutic efficacy.
