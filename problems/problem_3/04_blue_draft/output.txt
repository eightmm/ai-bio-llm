## AI-Driven Mini‑Binder Discovery Pipeline for Selective TNFR Targeting in TNBC  
*(TNFα–ΔNp63α axis–focused design)*

**Overall assumption and scope**  
- The goal is *computational discovery and prioritization* of TNFR‑selective mini‑binders; experimental validation is downstream and not performed here.  
- Structural models of TNFR1/2 extracellular domains are assumed to be available (experimental or AlphaFold‑predicted).  
- Binding affinity, kinetics, and off‑target risks are *predicted* with known uncertainty; rankings are therefore probabilistic, not definitive.

### **1. Binder의 TNFR1/2 결합 부위 선정 (Epitope Selection)**

**Objective**  
Select TNFR1- or TNFR2‑specific epitopes that encode desired signaling bias (antagonism vs agonism) relevant to TNBC and the TNFα–ΔNp63α axis.

**Tools / Approaches**  
- Structural analysis of TNFR1/2 extracellular domains (CRD1–CRD4) using experimental structures or AlphaFold models.  
- Interface mapping against TNFα‑binding sites and PLAD regions.  
- Literature‑guided functional annotation of epitopes (ligand blocking vs clustering modulation).

**Selection Logic**  
- **TNFR1 (generally antagonistic intent):**  
  - CRD1–CRD3 TNFα‑contact regions → ligand‑blocking antagonists.  
  - CRD4 or opposite‑face epitopes → disruption of receptor clustering/signaling complex assembly.  
- **TNFR2 (agonist or antagonist, context‑dependent):**  
  - Same‑face (Group I) epitopes → potential clustering/agonism.  
  - Opposite‑face (Group II) or PLAD‑adjacent epitopes → antagonism or signaling suppression.

**Output → Next Step Input**  
- 3–5 epitope definitions per receptor, specified as residue sets (“interface hotspots”) for generative design.

**Caveat**  
- Epitope–signaling relationships are inferred from structural and prior functional data; cell‑context effects are not modeled here.

### **2. Binder의 생물물리적 제약 조건 반영 (Biophysical Constraints)**

**Objective**  
Ensure designed mini‑binders are developable, stable, and manufacturable while retaining binding potential.

**Design Constraints**  
- **Length:** 40–70 aa (target 50–65 aa).  
- **Topology:** β₂αβ₂ or compact helical bundles with defined hydrophobic core.  
- **Charge:** Net charge −5 to +5; pI 5.5–8.5.  
- **Stability:** Predicted high folding confidence; optional 1–2 disulfide bonds.  
- **Solubility:** Minimize exposed hydrophobic patches; avoid aggregation‑prone motifs.  
- **Manufacturability:** No signal peptides, cryptic cleavage sites, or unwanted glycosylation motifs.

**Tools / Approaches**  
- Constraint conditioning during generative design.  
- Sequence‑based solubility and developability filters post‑design.

**Output → Next Step Input**  
- Explicit scaffold and sequence constraints fed into backbone and sequence design models.

**Caveat**  
- Solubility and expression are predicted from sequence and remain imperfect proxies for real expression yields.

### **3. 후보 binder 서열 설계 (De Novo Sequence Design)**

**Objective**  
Generate diverse mini‑binder sequences that satisfy structural and biophysical constraints while targeting selected TNFR epitopes.

**Primary Tools**  
- **RFdiffusion:** De novo backbone generation conditioned on TNFR structure and epitope hotspots.  
- **ProteinMPNN:** Sequence design on fixed backbones with conserved framework and variable paratope.

**Procedure**  
1. Generate 50–100 backbone designs per epitope with RFdiffusion.  
2. Filter backbones by predicted fold quality.  
3. For each backbone, generate 10–20 sequence variants with ProteinMPNN.  
4. Validate monomer folding via AlphaFold‑based confidence metrics.

**Output → Next Step Input**  
- Hundreds to thousands of mini‑binder sequences with predicted folded structures.

**Alternative Approaches**  
- Rosetta‑based de novo design (lower throughput).  
- Other inverse‑folding neural networks.

**Caveat**  
- High predicted fold confidence does not guarantee functional binding.

### **4. 후보 binder–TNFR 결합 구조 및 결합 특성 예측 (Structure & Binding Analysis)**

**Objective**  
Confirm intended binding mode and estimate affinity/kinetics.

**Tools**  
- **AlphaFold (complex mode):** Predict binder–TNFR1/2 complex structures.  
- **Rosetta flex_ddG:** Estimate binding free energy (ΔΔG → approximate Kd).  
- **ML‑based scoring models:** Supplement affinity and kinetics (kon, koff) estimation.

**Metrics / Filters**  
- Interface pAE < ~5 Å; interface pLDDT > ~70.  
- Favorable Rosetta binding energies (relative ranking).  
- Predicted kon > 10⁴ M⁻¹s⁻¹; koff compatible with sustained receptor engagement.

**Output → Next Step Input**  
- Shortlisted candidates with predicted structures, Kd, kon, koff estimates.

**Caveat**  
- Absolute Kd/kinetics values are approximate; used for *relative* ranking only.

### **5. 오프타깃 수용체 탐색 및 결합 가능성 평가 (Off‑Target Assessment)**

**Objective**  
Minimize cross‑reactivity, especially within the TNFR superfamily.

**Off‑Target Panel**  
- TNFRSF members: Fas, TRAIL‑R1/R2, LTβR, CD27, CD40, OX40, 4‑1BB, GITR, etc.

**Tools / Approaches**  
- Structure‑based docking of binders to off‑target receptors.  
- Sequence‑embedding similarity (protein language models) for selectivity prediction.  
- Epitope conservation analysis across receptors.

**Output → Next Step Input**  
- Off‑target risk score per candidate (likelihood × clinical relevance).

**Caveat**  
- Low‑probability off‑targets may still emerge experimentally; this step reduces, not eliminates, risk.

### **6. 후보 서열의 우선순위 지표화 (Ranking & Prioritization)**

**Objective**  
Select the most promising mini‑binders for experimental validation.

**Ranking Criteria (Multi‑Criteria Framework)**  
1. Predicted binding affinity (Kd).  
2. Structural confidence of complex (AlphaFold metrics).  
3. TNFR1 vs TNFR2 selectivity.  
4. Off‑target risk score.  
5. Predicted stability and solubility.  
6. Manufacturability indicators.  
7. Consistency with intended signaling bias (epitope geometry).

**Method**  
- Weighted multi‑criteria decision analysis (e.g., TOPSIS‑like scoring).  
- Sensitivity analysis by varying criterion weights.

**Final Output**  
- Rank‑ordered list of top 10–20 candidates.  
- Identification of top 3–5 *robust* leads recommended for experimental testing.

**Limitation**  
- Ranking reflects integrated computational predictions; experimental assays (SPR, cell signaling) are required to confirm mechanism and efficacy.
