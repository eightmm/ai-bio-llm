# AI-Driven Mini-Binder Discovery Pipeline for Selective TNF Receptor Targeting in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer: A Comprehensive Computational Design Strategy

## Executive Summary

This report presents a detailed computational pipeline for discovering mini-binder proteins that selectively modulate TNF receptor (TNFR) signaling to address triple-negative breast cancer through targeted disruption of the TNFα–ΔNp63α regulatory axis. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) represents one of the most aggressive breast cancer subtypes, characterized by the absence of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and HER2 expression, resulting in limited therapeutic options and poor clinical outcomes[37][40]. Recent evidence demonstrates that ΔNp63α functions as both a critical oncogenic driver in TNBC and a node of immunosuppressive signaling, particularly through regulation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and TNF receptor-mediated pathways[20][23]. The proposed pipeline integrates state-of-the-art artificial intelligence-based protein design, structure prediction, and affinity estimation methodologies to systematically identify and prioritize mini-binder candidates that can selectively engage TNF receptors while minimizing off-target binding, immunogenicity, and undesired biological activities. The strategy explicitly accounts for the distinct signaling consequences of TNFR1 versus TNFR2 engagement, enabling rational selection of pathway-biased binders that can preferentially activate pro-survival TNFR2 signaling while blocking pro-apoptotic TNFR1 pathways, or alternatively, leverage receptor-specific epitopes to achieve antagonistic activity through ligand blocking mechanisms. This comprehensive report outlines each stage of the pipeline, including epitope identification, biophysical constraint definition, de novo sequence design using generative models, structure-aware complex prediction, binding kinetics estimation, systematic off-target screening, and multi-criteria candidate ranking to enable efficient prioritization of the most promising therapeutic candidates for experimental validation.

## TNF Receptor Biology and Therapeutic Rationale for TNBC Intervention

### TNF Receptor Structure and Signaling Architecture

TNF receptors represent a crucial intersection point in cellular decision-making between survival and death pathways, making them compelling therapeutic targets for diseases characterized by dysregulated inflammatory responses and immune dysfunction[5][9][21]. Both TNFR1 and TNFR2 are type I transmembrane receptors composed of four cysteine-rich domains (CRDs) in their extracellular regions, which are responsible for TNF ligand binding and receptor clustering[5][41]. However, the two receptors diverge significantly in their intracellular architecture and signaling outcomes. TNFR1 contains a death domain (DD) in its cytoplasmic tail that recruits adaptor proteins including TNFR1-associated death domain protein (TRADD), receptor-interacting protein kinase-1 (RIPK1), TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF) 2, and cellular inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (cIAPs), which can activate either pro-survival nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways or, under conditions of caspase-8 activation, pro-apoptotic Complex II signaling[5][21][51]. In contrast, TNFR2 lacks the DD and instead recruits TRAF2, cIAP1/cIAP2, and HOIP (a component of the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex, LUBAC) to activate both canonical NF-κB signaling through K63- and M1-linked ubiquitination and non-canonical NF-κB signaling through depletion of TRAF2-cIAP complexes that would otherwise suppress the accumulation of NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK)[5][21][54].

The structural organization of TNF receptors has revealed important principles for therapeutic intervention. The membrane-distal cysteine-rich domain (CRD) contains the pre-ligand binding assembly domain (PLAD), which mediates homotypic receptor interactions and enables pre-clustering of unligated receptors through lateral diffusion and association[41][51]. This pre-assembly is crucial for the subsequent formation of productive signaling complexes upon TNF binding, as the ligand-independent dimer formation through PLAD interactions provides the spatial organization necessary for efficient recruitment of downstream signaling components[41]. Furthermore, recent structural studies of TNF–TNFR1 complexes have revealed that binding of the TNF trimer (which presents three equivalent receptor-binding sites) to receptor dimers results in the formation of extended signaling networks with characteristic spiral arrangements, in which CRD4 plays a critical role in stabilizing these network assemblies[41]. The epitope landscape across the four CRDs is heterogeneous, with different regions contributing differentially to ligand binding, receptor clustering, and downstream signal transduction, providing multiple opportunities for selective binder design targeting specific structural and functional properties.

### TNFR1 and TNFR2 Divergent Signaling and Therapeutic Implications

The differential roles of TNFR1 and TNFR2 in immune regulation and cancer progression have been extensively characterized, revealing a complex relationship in which TNFR1 generally promotes pro-inflammatory responses and cell death, while TNFR2 mediates pro-survival, regenerative, and immunoregulatory effects[5][9][12][21][54]. In macrophages and other innate immune cells, TNFR1 engagement activates classical NF-κB signaling through the canonical IκB kinase (IKK) complex containing NEMO, IKKα, and IKKβ, leading to phosphorylation and proteasomal degradation of inhibitor of kappa B-alpha (IκBα) and subsequent nuclear translocation of RelA/p50 NF-κB heterodimers[5][9][51]. This pathway drives expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNF itself, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-12 (IL-12), and can transition to pro-apoptotic signaling upon internalization of the TNFR1 signaling complex and recruitment of FADD and caspase-8[5][9]. In contrast, TNFR2 preferentially activates the non-canonical NF-κB pathway through accumulation of NIK, which phosphorylates IKKα homodimers to generate RelB/p52 heterodimers that promote immune cell survival and function, and additionally suppresses the pro-inflammatory function of TNFR1 through competitive depletion of TRAF2 and cIAPs from TNFR1 signaling complexes[5][21][54]. This crosstalk between TNFR1 and TNFR2 signaling has profound implications for therapeutic strategy; wholesale TNF blockade eliminates both pathways and can paradoxically impair protective immune responses and tissue homeostasis, whereas selective manipulation of TNFR1 versus TNFR2 engagement offers opportunities to amplify beneficial TNFR2-mediated immune regulation while suppressing TNFR1-dependent pro-inflammatory pathology[5][54].

Particularly relevant to TNBC therapeutics is the role of TNFR2 in the expansion, survival, and function of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and other immunosuppressive cell populations[5][12][54]. TNFR2 signaling on CD4+FoxP3+ natural Tregs (nTregs) stabilizes the Treg phenotype in inflammatory environments and promotes their expansion and immunoregulatory functions, suggesting that selective TNFR2 agonism could theoretically amplify Treg-mediated immune tolerance[5][12][54]. Conversely, TNFR1 engagement on tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and activated T cells can promote both inflammatory differentiation and pro-apoptotic signaling, particularly under conditions of limited costimulation. In TNBC specifically, the TNFα–ΔNp63α axis has emerged as a critical regulator of myeloid-derived suppressor cell recruitment and function; ΔNp63α expression in TNBC cells drives expression of the chemokines CXCL2 and CCL22, which recruit MDSCs to the tumor microenvironment and promote immune suppression[20][23]. Additionally, TNFα–TNFR2 signaling directly sustains MDSC survival and function, providing a potential therapeutic intervention point through selective TNFR2 targeting to disrupt MDSC-mediated immune suppression while sparing beneficial TNFR2 signaling on Tregs and other immune cells[12].

### Biased Signaling and Epitope-Specific Targeting

The concept of biased signaling, in which a ligand or allosteric modulator preferentially engages distinct signaling pathways through selective stabilization of specific receptor conformations or recruitment of particular adapter proteins, has gained prominence in protein therapeutics and offers particular advantages for TNF receptor targeting[2][5][21]. Recent work on biparatopic antibodies targeting TNFR2 has demonstrated that the relative positioning of two epitope-specific binders can dramatically influence whether the resulting complex assumes a conformation favorable for ligand agonism or antagonism[2]. Specifically, when two binders bind to epitopes on the same face of TNFR2 (the same group in the cylindrical domain organization), they engage at acute angles that facilitate receptor clustering and activation of downstream signaling; conversely, when binders bind to epitopes on opposite faces of the receptor, they result in 1:1 binding complexes that prevent receptor oligomerization and instead block TNFα interaction through direct steric hindrance or allosteric mechanisms[2]. This structure-function relationship suggests that precise epitope selection for mini-binder design can enable rational control over whether a given binder acts as an agonist, antagonist, or neutral antagonist depending on the biological context and the specific TNFR epitope targeted.

The molecular basis of epitope-specific signaling selectivity lies in the structural organization of the TNF receptor extracellular domain and the role of specific CRD regions in ligand binding and receptor clustering. TNF binds with approximately 220-fold higher affinity to TNFR1 (\(K_d\) approximately 1.9 × 10⁻¹¹ M) compared to TNFR2 (\(K_d\) approximately 4.2 × 10⁻¹⁰ M), and this difference arises from stabilization of the TNF-TNFR1 complex through multiple contacts and conformational selection rather than simple binding site complementarity[5][54]. The membrane-proximal CRDs (particularly CRD3 and CRD4) are more variable in conformation and may undergo ligand-induced conformational changes that stabilize signaling-competent receptor oligomers[2][41]. Epitopes in the membrane-distal CRDs (CRD1 and CRD2) are more directly involved in TNF contact and ligand discrimination[2]. By targeting specific epitopes within this landscape, binders can be designed to either promote or inhibit productive TNF-TNFR interactions, to stabilize or destabilize receptor pre-clustering through PLAD interactions, or to preferentially engage receptor conformations associated with distinct signaling outcomes[2].

## Mini-Binder Design Framework and Biophysical Constraints

### Rationale for Mini-Binder Scaffolds in Therapeutic Development

Mini-binders represent a class of engineered proteins typically 40-70 amino acids in length, substantially smaller than conventional therapeutic antibodies (approximately 150 kDa) or even nanobodies (approximately 15 kDa), that offer significant advantages for therapeutic development including improved tissue penetration, reduced immunogenicity risk, rapid manufacturing, and compatibility with oral bioavailability platforms[15]. The hyperstability of synthetic mini-binder scaffolds, which are typically engineered from synthetic three-dimensional structures rather than derived from natural protein families, provides a foundation for mutagenesis and directed evolution to achieve high-affinity binding to arbitrary targets[15]. Additionally, the modular nature of mini-binders enables multifunctional constructs in which binding and signaling domains are combined within a single molecule, or in which multiple mini-binders are used to create multivalent or multispecific therapeutics[15].

For TNFR targeting, mini-binders offer particular advantages over conventional approaches. First, the compact size facilitates the rational positioning of multiple epitope contacts within a single polypeptide, enabling design of bivalent or biparatopic mini-binders that can simultaneously engage two distinct epitopes on TNFR and achieve the enhanced selectivity and signaling bias that biparatopic interactions provide[2][15]. Second, the hyperstability of engineered mini-binder scaffolds, with thermal stability typically in the 70-80°C range, provides a robust foundation for incorporation of high-affinity binding surfaces that tolerate the extensive mutagenesis often required for epitope targeting[15]. Third, the reduced molecular weight and improved tissue penetration compared to full-length antibodies may enable enhanced tumor penetration and spatially restricted signaling modulation within the TNBC microenvironment[15]. Fourth, synthetic mini-binder designs are less likely to activate antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) or complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) pathways that are mediated by the Fc region of conventional antibodies, reducing the risk of unintended depletion of TNFR-expressing immune populations[15].

### Biophysical Constraint Definition for Mini-Binder Engineering

Successful mini-binder development requires explicit definition and implementation of biophysical constraints that ensure not only high binding affinity and specificity but also favorable developability characteristics that facilitate manufacturing, formulation, and in vivo stability. These constraints can be organized into multiple categories encompassing structural, thermodynamic, kinetic, and practical manufacturing considerations.

Structural constraints begin with scaffold topology and framework design. Synthetic mini-binder scaffolds typically employ one of several proven topologies including triple-helix bundles (α₃ topology), β₂αβ₂ (two pairs of antiparallel beta strands flanking a central alpha helix), or hybrid structures combining elements of both[15]. The choice of topology directly influences the geometric space available for paratope design, the degree of conformational flexibility, and the evolvability of the scaffold toward achieving high-affinity binding[15]. For TNFR targeting, the β₂αβ₂ topology has demonstrated superior evolvability compared to α₃ topologies in directed evolution experiments, suggesting its preferential use when rapid affinity maturation may be required[15]. Framework length should be constrained to the 40-70 amino acid range to preserve therapeutic potential, with target length typically between 50-65 amino acids for hybrid topologies that maintain a large hydrophobic core while accommodating diverse paratope structures[15].

Charge and hydrophobicity constraints are critical for solubility, thermostability, and immunogenicity. Mini-binder designs should maintain net charge in the range of -5 to +5 to minimize aggregation tendency and off-target electrostatic interactions; designs with excessive charge heterogeneity or high positive charge density have shown increased tendency toward non-specific binding and cellular uptake[15]. Surface-exposed hydrophobic patches larger than approximately 200 Ų should be minimized to prevent aggregation and enhance aqueous solubility, with particular attention to reducing solvent-exposed hydrophobic residues at positions that are not critical for target binding[32][35]. The buried surface area (BSA) of the mini-binder should be calculated for all proposed designs, with a target of 30-50% of total surface area buried within the hydrophobic core to maintain both folding stability and conformational flexibility[15]. Highly conserved positions within the scaffold framework should be preserved to maintain folding fidelity, as random mutagenesis in framework regions has shown dramatically reduced success rates for functional binder generation[15].

Thermodynamic and kinetic constraints define the binding performance targets. Target affinity (Kd) should be in the 0.1-10 nM range, with lower affinities (Kd > 100 nM) potentially requiring bivalent or multivalent presentation to achieve therapeutically relevant occupancy, while excessively tight affinities (Kd < 1 pM) may result in off-rate limited efficacy or cellular sequestration[13][18][44]. The association rate (kon) should be sufficient to ensure rapid target engagement in vivo, with a target kon > 10⁴ M⁻¹s⁻¹ to ensure binding kinetics compatible with physiological timescales[19][22]. The dissociation rate (koff) determines how long the binder remains engaged with the target; for a single-dose therapeutic, koff values in the range of 10⁻³ to 10⁻⁴ s⁻¹ (corresponding to half-lives of 1-10 minutes for the binder-target complex) are typically sufficient to achieve durable pharmacodynamic effects when the binder is present at saturating concentrations in circulation[19][22]. For TNFR targeting, the dissociation kinetics must account for the dynamic equilibrium of TNFR clustering and signaling complex assembly, as binders that dissociate too rapidly may fail to stabilize the desired receptor conformations[2][41].

Manufacturing and developability constraints are often underemphasized in early-stage protein design but are critical for translating computational designs into clinical therapeutics. Expression level constraints require that mini-binder designs be compatible with recombinant production in standard mammalian cell lines (CHO, HEK293) or microbial systems at titers of at least 1-2 g/L to enable economically feasible manufacturing[45][48]. Sequence composition should avoid repetitive motifs, excessive compositional bias (e.g., >20% of any single amino acid), and problematic sequences that trigger cellular degradation or misfolding[45]. The presence of cryptic proteolytic cleavage sites, N-glycosylation sites (if aglycosylation is desired), and other post-translational modification signals should be explicitly screened and removed[45]. Disulfide bond formation should be carefully designed with an appropriate balance of structural disulfides to enhance stability without creating redox imbalances that impair folding efficiency[15]. The theoretical pI (isoelectric point) should ideally fall in the range of 5.5-8.5 to ensure compatibility with standard chromatographic purification and formulation buffers; designs with pI < 5.0 or > 9.0 often exhibit poor expression and extreme sensitivity to pH and salt concentration[15].

## Epitope Identification and Selection Strategy for TNFR1/2 Targeting

### Structural Analysis and Ligand-Binding Epitope Mapping

The first critical stage of the mini-binder discovery pipeline is identification and selection of appropriate epitopes on TNFR1 and TNFR2 that serve as binder targets. This process requires integrating structural biology, biophysical characterization, and functional signaling data to identify epitopes that are both structurally accessible (not buried in native receptor oligomers) and functionally relevant to the desired therapeutic outcome. The structural foundation for epitope mapping comes from available crystal structures and cryo-electron microscopy reconstructions of TNFR-ligand complexes, particularly the TNF-TNFR2 complex (Protein Data Bank entry 3ALQ) and TNF-TNFR1 complex structures that reveal the precise spatial arrangement of receptor-ligand contacts[2][5][41].

Analysis of the TNF-TNFR2 complex structure reveals that TNF binding is distributed across the four cysteine-rich domains, with primary contacts involving CRD1, CRD2, and portions of CRD3, while CRD4 maintains more flexible positioning[2][41]. The TNFα-binding region of TNFR2 encompasses multiple discontinuous epitopes across the cylindrical domain structure; when viewed from the top, these epitopes can be conceptually organized into two groups, Group I epitopes (located on the same face as the TNFα-binding region, including epitopes from CRD1, CRD2, and CRD3) and Group II epitopes (located on the opposite face)[2]. Experimental characterization of monoclonal antibodies targeting TNFR2 has revealed that the epitope location directly determines whether the resulting antibody-TNFR2 complex promotes or inhibits TNFα signaling; bivalent antibodies in which both variable regions engage epitopes from Group I (same-face epitopes) adopt acute angles and promote receptor clustering and agonistic signaling, while bivalent antibodies in which the two variable regions engage Group I and Group II epitopes (opposite-face epitopes) result in 1:1 stoichiometric binding and antagonistic activity through ligand blocking[2].

For TNFR1, structural analysis reveals a similar overall architecture to TNFR2, with four cysteine-rich domains forming a cylindrical structure, but distinct topological positioning of functional epitopes. The membrane-distal CRD1 of TNFR1 contains the PLAD domain and is involved in both ligand binding and homotypic receptor interactions; deletion or mutation of CRD1 eliminates TNF binding and abrogates responsiveness to soluble TNF, indicating that CRD1 is essential for both ligand contact and the formation of signaling-competent receptor clusters[38][41]. The differential responsiveness of TNFR1 versus TNFR2 to soluble versus membrane-bound TNF arises in part from the structural properties of the stalk region (the transmembrane-proximal extracellular domain) and the role of CRD3 and CRD4 in facilitating receptor clustering; the TNFR1 stalk appears to permit more rapid lateral diffusion and clustering, whereas the TNFR2 stalk provides more structural constraint and requires membrane-bound TNF or externally imposed clustering for full activation[5][54].

### Biased Signaling Epitope Selection

Building on the structural foundation, epitope selection must explicitly incorporate consideration of how different epitope engagements influence downstream signaling outcomes. For TNFR1, the therapeutic goal in TNBC is typically to reduce pro-apoptotic and pro-inflammatory signaling while potentially preserving pro-survival NF-κB activation that sustains immune cell function. Epitopes in the TNFα-binding region (spanning CRD1-CRD3) are candidates for ligand-blocking binders that would prevent TNFα engagement and suppress both pro-survival and pro-apoptotic TNFR1 signaling[2][41]. Alternatively, epitopes on the opposite face of the receptor (Group II in the cylindrical model) or on the membrane-proximal CRD4 domain could be targeted by binders designed to prevent receptor clustering and signaling complex assembly without necessarily blocking TNFα binding, potentially enabling selective suppression of pro-apoptotic signaling while preserving NF-κB activation[2]. For TNFR2, the therapeutic goal is more nuanced: selective agonism (promoting NF-κB and pro-survival signaling while suppressing TNFR1-mediated pro-inflammatory effects) versus antagonism (blocking MDSC-promoting TNFR2 signaling on myeloid cells while sparing Treg-promoting TNFR2 signaling) represents distinct therapeutic strategies that would require fundamentally different epitope selections.

The selection process should proceed according to the following logic: (1) Define the therapeutic hypothesis clearly in terms of which receptor (TNFR1 versus TNFR2) and which signaling pathway (canonical NF-κB, non-canonical NF-κB, pro-apoptotic RIPK1-dependent, MAPK-dependent) should be modulated; (2) Review the published literature on monoclonal antibodies, nanobodies, and other protein binders that target TNFR1 or TNFR2, noting the epitope locations and signaling outcomes of well-characterized agents (e.g., Atrosimab for TNFR1, various TNFR2-selective antibodies)[2][5]; (3) Identify candidate epitope regions on the TNFR structure that, based on structural position and literature precedent, are likely to achieve the desired signaling outcome; (4) Validate the putative epitope-function relationships using available structural models of TNFR-ligand complexes and theoretical predictions of how binder engagement would influence receptor conformation and signaling complex assembly[2][41]; (5) Select 3-5 distinct epitope regions as primary targets for binder design, with additional variant epitope definitions for secondary design campaigns if initial candidates fail to meet affinity or specificity targets[2].

Specific epitope candidates for TNFR2 antagonism in TNBC might include: (A) the TNFα-contact residues on CRD1/CRD2 (Group I epitopes) targeted by binders designed to prevent ligand binding; (B) the PLAD domain region on CRD1 targeted by binders designed to prevent receptor pre-clustering; and (C) the membrane-proximal CRD3/CRD4 region targeted by binders designed to prevent signaling complex assembly[2][41]. For TNFR1 antagonism, candidate epitopes might include similar regions, with particular attention to CRD4 as a potential target for binders designed to prevent the extended signaling network formation that appears critical for TNFR1-mediated apoptotic signaling[41]. The final epitope selection should also consider predicted accessibility in the cellular context; epitopes that are frequently occupied by endogenous TNF or other TNFR-binding proteins in vivo may prove less effective than epitopes that remain accessible under physiological conditions[2][41].

## Computational Pipeline: Sequence Design Using Generative Models and Structure-Guided Conditioning

### RFdiffusion and ProteinMPNN Integration for De Novo Mini-Binder Design

The sequence design phase of the pipeline leverages recent advances in generative artificial intelligence models for protein structure and sequence design, particularly the RoseTTAFold diffusion (RFdiffusion) model for structure generation and the ProteinMPNN model for sequence design. RFdiffusion represents a revolutionary advance in protein design, combining structure prediction networks (fine-tuned from RoseTTAFold) with generative diffusion models to directly generate novel protein backbones with target-specified binding properties[3][6][55]. Unlike earlier de novo protein design approaches that required specification of protein scaffolds and iterative Rosetta-based optimization—often requiring tens of thousands of designs to be experimentally screened to find a single functional binder—RFdiffusion demonstrates extremely high computational success rates, with many design problems requiring experimental screening of fewer than 5-10 designs per challenge[3][6][58].

The RFdiffusion pipeline begins with specification of the target structure (TNFR1 or TNFR2) and definition of the binder requirements, including target binding interface hotspots (residues on the TNFR that the binder should contact), desired binder length, symmetry constraints (if applicable), and other spatial constraints[3][55]. The model was fine-tuned on a dataset of known protein complex structures, enabling it to generate binders in the context of the target and to design binding proteins that achieve specific spatial relationships with the target[3][55]. The generative process employs a Markov chain-like denoising trajectory, starting from random protein backbone frames and iteratively refining the structure toward designated interface hotspots and global fold stability constraints[3][55]. Importantly, RFdiffusion can condition the design on multiple types of constraints: (1) target structure specification to design binders to a specific target; (2) interface hotspot specification to focus binding surface design on particular regions of the target; (3) symmetry constraints for designing oligomeric assemblies or scaffolded multimeric binders; (4) global structure constraints to limit the design space to predetermined scaffold topologies or length ranges; and (5) functional motif scaffolding to design binders that present specific structural features at defined positions[3][55].

For the TNFR mini-binder design application, RFdiffusion would be employed in the following manner: (1) Download or compute high-quality structural models of TNFR1 and TNFR2 extracellular domains, either from experimental structures in the Protein Data Bank or from predicted structures generated by AlphaFold 2[3][11]; (2) For each selected epitope region, define the interface hotspots by identifying residues that should be targeted for binder contacts, typically including 5-15 residues that form a spatially coherent binding patch[3]; (3) Set design constraints specifying mini-binder length (50-65 amino acids), allowed topology (e.g., β₂αβ₂ topology based on superior evolvability), and target affinity range (predicted pAE values indicating confidence in predicted complex conformation); (4) Run RFdiffusion in batches of 50-100 designs per epitope region to generate a diverse set of candidate binder backbone structures that are predicted to bind the target epitope with high confidence[3][55]; (5) Filter candidate backbones based on in silico validation metrics including predicted folding confidence (mean predicted aligned error <5 Å), complex stability (global distance test score indicating confidence in binder positioning relative to target), and interface complementarity (shape and electrostatic complementarity metrics)[3][55].

Following successful backbone generation, ProteinMPNN is applied to design amino acid sequences compatible with each generated backbone. ProteinMPNN represents a substantial advance in protein sequence design, achieving substantially higher sequence recovery on native protein backbones (52.4% recovery) compared to structure-based sequence design methods like Rosetta (32.9% recovery)[7][10]. ProteinMPNN employs a message-passing neural network trained on a large corpus of protein structures and sequences to predict, in an autoregressive manner from N-terminus to C-terminus, the most probable amino acid sequence that will fold to a specified backbone structure[7][10]. Critically, ProteinMPNN can be conditioned on partial sequence information (e.g., fixing interface residues in contact with the TNFR target) and can apply different design strategies for different regions (e.g., high diversity in the paratope region contacting the target, conservation of framework residues)[7][10].

The ProteinMPNN design pipeline for TNFR mini-binders would proceed as follows: (1) For each RFdiffusion-generated backbone, specify interface residues that should maintain contacts with the TNFR target by identifying all backbone positions within ~5 Å of target atoms; (2) Designate framework residues that should be highly conserved to maintain folding stability (typically residues in the hydrophobic core, or residues at secondary structure boundaries); (3) Designate paratope residues (those at the binder-target interface) as fully variable to maximize sequence diversity and affinity optimization; (4) Run ProteinMPNN in sampling mode to generate 10-20 sequence variants per backbone, with sampling temperature and diversity parameters tuned to maximize sequence variation in the paratope while maintaining framework conservation[7][10]; (5) Score each generated sequence using AlphaFold 2 to verify that the predicted structure closely matches the design backbone (RMSD < 2 Å), filtering out sequences that demonstrate poor folding confidence or predicted misfolding[7][10].

### Constraint-Based Design and Refinement

Beyond the basic RFdiffusion-ProteinMPNN pipeline, several refinement strategies can be employed to explicitly incorporate the biophysical constraints defined earlier in the design process. Residue bias strategies can be applied to ProteinMPNN to preferentially or disfavor specific amino acids at designated positions[7][10]. For instance, highly positively charged residues (lysine, arginine) can be disfavored at positions predicted to be surface-exposed but not directly involved in target binding, to minimize electrostatic off-target interactions. Conversely, highly hydrophobic residues can be disfavored at surface-exposed positions to minimize aggregation. Positions predicted to contact the target can be biased toward residues that are enriched in high-affinity protein-protein interfaces, such as aromatic residues (phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan) and branched aliphatic residues (leucine, isoleucine, valine).

Disulfide bond design can be explicitly optimized by designating cysteine pairs that are predicted to form hydrogen bonds and disulfide linkages based on side-chain positioning in the designed structure. For mini-binder scaffolds, typically 1-3 disulfide bonds are desirable to enhance thermostability while avoiding excessive covalent constraint that would limit conformational flexibility needed for binding[15]. Rosetta's disulfide-design protocols can be applied to identify energetically favorable cysteine pairs that maintain good geometry for disulfide bond formation while minimizing steric clashes[26][29].

Solubility and manufacturability filters can be applied post-design to identify sequences that are likely to express at high levels and remain soluble. Predictions of protein solubility from sequence using machine learning models trained on large databases of recombinant protein expression data have demonstrated moderate predictive power[32][35]. Applying such models to filter designed sequences can eliminate designs with predicted low solubility, although it should be noted that solubility predictions remain imperfect and experimentally poorly expressing designs occasionally emerge from sequence-only predictions[32][35]. Sequence-based toxicity screening can be applied to identify and remove any cryptic proteolytic cleavage sites that might render the binder susceptible to degradation by endogenous proteases. Standard bioinformatic screening for signal peptides, N-glycosylation sites, and other post-translational modification signals can be performed to ensure that undesired modifications do not occur.

## Structure Prediction and Binding Affinity Estimation

### AlphaFold 3 for Complex Structure Modeling

Following sequence design, the binding interactions between mini-binder candidates and their TNFR targets must be predicted and evaluated to identify the most promising designs. AlphaFold 3, the latest generation of AlphaFold structure prediction technology, represents a transformative advancement in this capability, extending beyond monomer structure prediction to encompass protein–protein complexes, including the interactions of proteins with ligands, DNA, RNA, and chemical modifications[8][11]. AlphaFold 3 demonstrates a 50% improvement in accuracy for predicting protein-protein interactions compared with existing state-of-the-art methods, and uniquely surpasses physics-based tools for biomolecular structure prediction, making it the first AI-based system to achieve this milestone[11].

For TNFR mini-binder design, AlphaFold 3 would be applied in the following workflow: (1) For each designed mini-binder sequence, create an input containing the binder sequence and the TNFR target sequence (or a structural fragment containing the target epitope); (2) Run AlphaFold 3 prediction in complex mode to generate a 3D model of the binder-TNFR complex; (3) Assess the predicted structure using multiple quality metrics including the predicted aligned error (pAE) for the complex interface (target pAE < 5 Å for high-confidence complex predictions), the per-residue confidence score (pLDDT > 70 for interface residues indicates high-confidence predictions), and visual inspection of the resulting complex structure to verify physically reasonable binding geometry and absence of steric clashes[8][11].

The predicted complex structures provide multiple layers of information useful for binder selection: (1) Confirmation that the designed interface is actually predicted to be stable and make appropriate atomic contacts (pAE < 5 Å across the interface indicates high confidence); (2) Identification of any predicted misfolding or conformational problems in the binder or target upon complex formation (high pLDDT scores throughout indicate well-resolved regions); (3) Spatial positioning information that enables assessment of whether the predicted complex geometry is consistent with the intended functional outcome (e.g., whether the binder is predicted to block TNFα binding, prevent receptor clustering, or enable favorable signaling-complex assembly)[8][11].

Structures with low interface confidence (pAE > 8 Å across binder-target interface, or pLDDT < 60 in interface regions) should be flagged as low-priority for experimental validation, as they suggest either incorrect folding of the designed sequence or incompatibility of the designed binding interface with actual structural constraints[8][11]. Structures with intermediate confidence (pAE 5-8 Å, pLDDT 60-70) should be retained for further analysis but deprioritized compared to high-confidence predictions[8][11].

### Binding Affinity and Kinetics Prediction

While AlphaFold 3 provides high-quality structure predictions, it does not directly predict binding affinity or kinetic parameters including kon, koff, and Kd. Multiple complementary approaches can be applied to estimate these crucial parameters for ranking mini-binder candidates.

Physics-based methods including Rosetta-based affinity predictions can provide quantitative estimates of binding free energy changes. Rosetta's flex_ddg protocol is capable of predicting changes in binding affinity for protein-protein interfaces, estimating the ΔΔG of binding through iterative sampling of side-chain rotamers and backbone coordinates in the context of a force field that accounts for electrostatics, van der Waals interactions, hydrogen bonding, and burial of solvent-exposed polar atoms[13][26][29]. Application of Rosetta to predicted AlphaFold 3 structures can yield semi-quantitative predictions of binding affinity; while individual predictions typically show root-mean-square errors (RMSE) of 1-2 kcal/mol compared to experimental values, consensus predictions across multiple Rosetta protocols or combined predictions with machine learning methods can achieve RMSE values approaching 0.8-1.0 kcal/mol[13][26][29]. For the TNFR mini-binder application, Rosetta affinity predictions would be computed for the top 50-100 candidate binder sequences predicted by AlphaFold 3 to have high-confidence binding, enabling prioritization based on estimated binding strength[13][26][29].

Machine learning-based approaches for binding affinity prediction have emerged as complementary to physics-based methods. Random Forest-based scoring functions trained on large databases of protein-ligand complexes have demonstrated Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.78 with experimental binding affinity data, and ensemble methods combining multiple machine learning algorithms can achieve even higher correlation[44]. However, most existing machine learning models for binding affinity have been trained predominantly on protein-small ligand interactions rather than protein-protein interactions, limiting their direct applicability to mini-binder design. More recent deep learning approaches incorporating graph neural networks and attention mechanisms have shown promise for protein-protein interaction scoring, and tools such as DeepRank-GNN, which converts protein-protein interface structures into residue-level graphs and applies graph neural network inference, have demonstrated competitive performance for scoring binding complex quality[52].

For binding kinetics prediction, machine learning models trained on quantitative structure-kinetics relationship (QSKR) datasets provide the most practical approach. Multiple machine learning algorithms including kernel-based methods, gradient-boosted decision trees, and neural networks have been applied to predict kon and koff from structural and compositional features[19][22]. Key features that drive kinetics predictions include hydrophobic and hydrogen bond interaction characteristics, buried surface area calculations, and per-residue energetic contributions[19][22]. Models trained on HSP90 inhibitor kinetics data have achieved R² values of 0.90 on training sets and 0.80 on test sets, demonstrating the viability of this approach[22]. Application of such models to the designed mini-binder-TNFR complexes would enable preliminary ranking based on predicted kon and koff values, although absolute accuracy of kinetics predictions remains limited and experimental validation would be required before final candidate selection[19][22].

An integrated approach combining AlphaFold 3 structure prediction, Rosetta affinity estimation, machine learning-based scoring, and kinetics prediction would provide complementary information for ranking mini-binder candidates. Designs predicted to have high AlphaFold 3 confidence (pAE < 5 Å), favorable Rosetta binding energy (ΔΔG < -15 kcal/mol, corresponding to approximate Kd in the 1-10 nM range), and kinetically compatible parameters (predicted kon > 10⁴ M⁻¹s⁻¹, koff compatible with target occupancy duration) would advance to subsequent stages of evaluation[13][26][29].

## Off-Target Receptor Screening and Specificity Assessment

### Structural and Sequence-Based Off-Target Identification

A critical step in mini-binder development is comprehensive assessment of potential off-target binding to other proteins, particularly other members of the TNF receptor superfamily (TNFRSF) and other inflammatory response receptors that might result in unintended biological activities or adverse effects. The TNF receptor superfamily comprises over 29 members sharing the characteristic cysteine-rich domain architecture, including TNFR1, TNFR2, Fas (CD95), TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) receptors, lymphotoxin beta receptor (LTβR), TNF receptor superfamily member 6B (TNFRSF6B, decoy receptor), and others[5]. Many of these receptors are expressed on immune cells and have critical roles in immune homeostasis, rendering off-target binding a significant safety concern.

The off-target screening process should proceed systematically through multiple stages: (1) Computational screening based on structural similarity; (2) Sequence-based predictive assessment; (3) Experimental validation for the most likely off-targets. For structural screening, the designed mini-binder structures and their predicted TNFR1/TNFR2 complex models should be computationally docked against structures of related TNF receptor family members. This can be accomplished using standard protein-protein docking approaches such as rigid-body docking followed by local refinement, or using the newer generation of AI-based docking methods[27][42][53]. Docking poses can be scored using energy functions or machine learning-based scoring, with high-scoring poses indicating potential off-target binding[27][42][53].

Sequence-based off-target assessment leverages protein language models such as ESM-2 (Evolutionary Scale Modeling), which encode protein sequences into high-dimensional vector embeddings that capture evolutionary and functional relationships between proteins[52]. A dedicated machine learning model trained on selectivity data can be applied to predict whether a designed mini-binder is likely to bind off-target proteins based on the ESM-2 embeddings of both the binder sequence and the off-target receptor sequence[14][52]. This approach operates at the sequence level and does not require explicit 3D structures, enabling rapid screening of many potential off-targets without the computational cost of structure-based docking[14][52].

Structural alignment analysis can identify regions of high similarity between the TNFR epitope targeted by the mini-binder and similar epitopes on related TNF family receptors. If the binder targets an epitope that is highly conserved across multiple TNFR family members, off-target binding is more likely than if the epitope is unique to TNFR1 or TNFR2[14][52]. Quantitative comparison of the predicted binder interface residues on TNFR1/TNFR2 with the corresponding positions on Fas, TRAIL receptors, and other TNFRs can identify whether sequence identity, chemical similarity, or geometric complementarity in the off-target would be expected to support binding[14][52].

### Prioritized Off-Target Panel Definition

Rather than attempting to exhaustively screen all possible off-targets, a risk-stratified approach defines a prioritized panel of high-priority off-targets based on clinical relevance and likelihood of off-target engagement. This panel should include: (1) All classical TNF receptor superfamily members (Fas, TRAIL-R1, TRAIL-R2, LTβR, CD27, CD30, CD40, OX40, 4-1BB, GITR), for which structural models are available and which have well-characterized immune functions relevant to TNBC immunotherapy[5][21]; (2) Decoy receptors and other TNF-family related proteins that might compete with or complement therapeutic TNFR targeting; (3) Distantly related immune receptors that occasionally show cross-reactivity with TNFR-targeting agents (e.g., some interleukin receptors, TNF-ligand family members).

For each off-target in the prioritized panel, three assessment criteria should be evaluated: (1) Predicted binding likelihood (structural docking scores, sequence-based selectivity models); (2) Clinical significance of off-target engagement (does binding to this off-target present a known safety risk?); (3) Tissue expression and accessibility (is the off-target expressed on cell types critical for the desired therapeutic outcome?). An off-target risk score can be calculated by combining these factors, enabling prioritization of follow-up characterization for the highest-risk off-targets[14].

For TNFR mini-binders, particular attention should be paid to TNFR1 versus TNFR2 selectivity, as inadvertent dual engagement of both receptors could result in complex, unpredictable signaling outcomes[5][21]. Structural analysis should verify that the designed epitope is sufficiently distinct between TNFR1 and TNFR2 (or sufficiently selective if dual targeting is intentional) to achieve the desired selectivity. The CRD1 and PLAD regions, while structurally conserved between TNFR1 and TNFR2, contain specific sequence variations that could be leveraged for selectivity; for instance, the stalk region differs substantially between the two receptors, potentially enabling selectivity through stalk-directed binders[5][54].

## Multi-Criteria Ranking Framework for Candidate Prioritization

### Integrated Scoring System Design

The final stage of the mini-binder discovery pipeline is consolidation of the multiple dimensions of candidate evaluation into a unified ranking framework that enables objective prioritization of the most promising candidates for experimental validation. Unlike early drug discovery where a single parameter (e.g., binding affinity) may dominate decision-making, therapeutic protein development requires balancing multiple, often competing objectives including binding affinity, selectivity, specificity, biophysical properties, thermostability, manufacturability, immunogenicity, and mechanistic appropriateness to the therapeutic goal[34].

A sophisticated multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) framework can be applied to systematically integrate these multiple scoring dimensions. The Stochastic Multicriteria Acceptability Analysis (SMAA) combined with the Technique for Order Performance by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) provides a mathematically rigorous framework for ranking alternatives (mini-binder candidates) across multiple criteria under conditions of measurement uncertainty and subjective weighting of criterion importance[34]. In this approach, each mini-binder candidate is scored across up to 8-12 different criteria, weights are assigned to each criterion reflecting its importance to therapeutic success, and the SMAA-TOPSIS algorithm probabilistically ranks candidates while accounting for uncertainty in both the scores and the weights[34].

The specific criteria for TNFR mini-binder ranking should include: (1) Predicted binding affinity (estimated Kd from Rosetta and machine learning models; lower is better, with a target range of 1-10 nM); (2) Binding specificity to intended TNFR epitope (evaluated by AlphaFold 3 interface confidence pAE; lower pAE [< 5 Å] is better); (3) Off-target binding risk (integrated risk score from structural and sequence-based off-target assessment; lower is better); (4) Predicted expression level and solubility (sequence-based machine learning predictions; higher is better for manufacturability); (5) Thermostability (predicted folding stability from AlphaFold 2/3 predictions and computational stability models; higher Tm or folding ΔG is better); (6) Mechanical appropriateness (does the predicted complex geometry match the intended functional outcome—ligand blocking for antagonists, clustering promotion for agonists, etc.; binary or semi-quantitative score); (7) Projected immunogenicity (sequence-based immunogenicity prediction models; lower predicted immunogenicity is better); (8) Kinetic compatibility (predicted kon and koff aligned with target occupancy and duration requirements; semi-quantitative score); (9) Predicted manufacturability (absence of problematic sequences, favorable pI, manageable hydrophobicity; combined binary score); (10) Epitope accessibility in native TNFR oligomers (structural analysis of whether the target epitope is exposed or buried in TNFR dimers/trimers; accessibility is better for most epitopes).

### Weighting Strategy and Sensitivity Analysis

The relative importance of each criterion should be determined through structured discussion involving the therapeutic team (medicinal chemists, structural biologists, clinical experts). For TNFR mini-binders targeting TNBC via the TNFα-ΔNp63α axis, a plausible weighting scheme might assign highest weight (20-25%) to predicted binding affinity and specificity, reflecting the fundamental requirement that the binder must engage its intended target with sufficient avidity; moderate weight (15-20%) to off-target binding risk and immunogenicity, reflecting the imperative to minimize adverse effects; and lower weight (5-10%) to kinetic and thermostability parameters, which may be optimized post-ranking through affinity maturation[34].

Importantly, MCDM frameworks enable sensitivity analysis in which the effect of varying criterion weights on final candidate rankings is systematically explored[34]. This analysis identifies robust top-tier candidates whose high ranking is relatively insensitive to uncertainty in weighting, versus borderline candidates whose rank changes substantially when criterion weights are adjusted. Robust candidates are preferred for experimental validation, as they are likely to retain high performance even if initial expectations about criterion importance prove incorrect[34].

The final output of the MCDM framework is a rank-ordered list of mini-binder candidates with associated ranking metrics including a composite "topness" score (reflecting the probability that the candidate remains highly ranked across different weight scenarios) and "retention probability" (quantifying the sensitivity of rank to measurement uncertainty)[34]. Typically, the top 10-20 candidates are selected for experimental characterization, with particular emphasis on the top 3-5 candidates predicted to be robust across multiple weighting scenarios[34].

## Integrated Pipeline Architecture and Workflow Implementation

### End-to-End Workflow Integration

The complete mini-binder discovery pipeline can be conceptualized as a series of sequential stages, each producing outputs that serve as inputs for subsequent stages, with quality-control checkpoints and filtering criteria applied at each transition. The overall workflow is as follows:

**Stage 1: Target Definition and Epitope Selection.** Define the therapeutic hypothesis (TNFR1 antagonism, TNFR2 agonism, dual targeting, etc.), identify candidate epitope regions from structural and functional literature, and select 3-5 epitope regions for design. Output: Epitope coordinates and interface hotspot definitions for RFdiffusion input.

**Stage 2: RFdiffusion De Novo Backbone Design.** Run RFdiffusion in batches of 50-100 designs per epitope, conditioning on target structure, interface hotspots, scaffold topology constraints, and length constraints. Filter backbones by in silico validation (AlphaFold 2 validation of monomer folding, interface complementarity metrics). Output: 150-300 high-confidence binder backbone structures (3-5 epitopes × 50-100 designs × filter stringency).

**Stage 3: ProteinMPNN Sequence Design.** For each filtered backbone, generate 10-20 sequence variants using ProteinMPNN with paratope diversity maximization and framework conservation. Apply residue bias and constraint specifications to enforce biophysical properties. Validate sequences using AlphaFold 2 (confirm predicted structure matches design backbone). Output: 1500-6000 designed mini-binder sequences with predicted structures.

**Stage 4: Complex Structure Prediction.** Run AlphaFold 3 on designed binder sequences paired with TNFR1 and/or TNFR2 target sequences. Filter by interface confidence (pAE < 5 Å), per-residue confidence (pLDDT > 70 in interface regions), and complex stability metrics. Output: 500-2000 high-confidence binder-TNFR complex structures.

**Stage 5: Binding Affinity Estimation.** Apply Rosetta flex_ddg to estimate binding free energy for top candidates. Apply machine learning affinity prediction models. Compare predictions across methods to identify consensus high-affinity designs. Output: Predicted Kd values and affinity rankings for 200-500 candidates.

**Stage 6: Kinetics Prediction.** Apply machine learning-based QSKR models to estimate kon and koff for top affinity candidates. Cross-check kinetics consistency with structure-based interface analysis. Output: Predicted kinetic parameters (kon, koff, Kd) for 100-200 top candidates.

**Stage 7: Off-Target Screening.** For top 100-200 candidates, perform structural docking against TNFRSF panel (Fas, TRAIL-R1/R2, LTβR, etc.). Apply sequence-based selectivity prediction (ESM-2 embeddings + machine learning). Compare off-target risk across candidates. Output: Off-target risk scoring and selectivity assessment for all top candidates.

**Stage 8: Immunogenicity Prediction.** Apply sequence-based immunogenicity prediction models to identify potential T-cell and B-cell epitopes. Compare immunogenicity predictions across top candidates. Output: Immunogenicity risk scores for all top candidates.

**Stage 9: Integrated Multi-Criteria Ranking.** Consolidate all evaluation metrics (affinity, specificity, off-target risk, thermostability, expression/solubility, immunogenicity, kinetics, manufacturability) into MCDM framework. Apply SMAA-TOPSIS to generate final rankings. Output: Rank-ordered list of top 10-20 mini-binder candidates with composite scoring and sensitivity analysis.

**Stage 10: Candidate Selection and Experimental Validation Plan.** Select top 5-10 candidates for experimental characterization (surface plasmon resonance for kinetics validation, cell-based assays for signaling modulation, potential off-target testing). Develop ranking-guided iteration strategy for affinity maturation if initial characterization reveals lower-than-predicted performance. Output: Experimentally validated mini-binder leads for optimization and development.

### Tool Justification and Alternative Approaches

The choice of specific computational tools in each pipeline stage reflects a balance between predictive accuracy, computational efficiency, accessibility, and compatibility with downstream analysis. RFdiffusion was selected for scaffold-free de novo binder design because it has demonstrated dramatically improved success rates (often < 5 designs need be experimentally screened to find function) compared to earlier Rosetta-based approaches (which required screening tens of thousands of designs), and because it enables flexible conditioning on target structure and interface hotspots without requiring pre-specification of protein scaffolds[3][6][58]. Alternative approaches to scaffold-free design might include generative flow matching models or other diffusion-based architectures, which would likely provide comparable performance[3].

ProteinMPNN was selected for sequence design based on its substantially superior sequence recovery on native backbones (52.4% vs. 32.9% for Rosetta) and its architectural flexibility for incorporating design constraints and biases[7]. Alternative sequence design approaches might include other neural network-based methods such as OmegaFold or inverse folding approaches like AntiFold, which have shown promise for antibody sequence design and might be adapted for mini-binder applications[27][50].

AlphaFold 3 was selected for complex structure prediction because it represents the current state-of-the-art in protein-protein complex modeling, with 50% improvement over existing methods and unique ability to surpass physics-based tools[11]. AlphaFold 2 with complex prediction modes would provide an alternative with slightly lower accuracy but substantially lower computational cost[8]. For applications requiring high-throughput complex prediction across thousands of designs, AlphaFold 2 might be preferred due to computational efficiency, with more computationally expensive AlphaFold 3 predictions reserved for the highest-priority candidates[8][11].

Rosetta was selected for binding affinity estimation because of its well-documented performance on protein-protein binding and its flexibility for different sampling strategies and energy functions[13][26][29]. Alternative affinity prediction approaches might include physics-based free energy perturbation (FEP) calculations, which can achieve higher absolute accuracy but are computationally expensive and typically limited to predictions for smaller numbers of designs[31]. Machine learning-based approaches are increasingly competitive and could eventually supplant Rosetta-based predictions as more training data becomes available[44][47].

Off-target screening using structural docking and ESM-2 embeddings was selected because it provides complementary sequence-level and structure-level information without requiring computationally expensive kinetics simulations[14][52]. Alternative off-target assessment approaches might include more extensive QSAR-based modeling or experimental high-throughput screening against protein arrays, which would provide definitive off-target information but at much higher cost[14].

The SMAA-TOPSIS multi-criteria ranking framework was selected because it provides mathematically rigorous handling of multiple competing objectives and enables sensitivity analysis to identify robust candidates[34]. Alternative ranking approaches might include weighted linear scoring (simpler but less sophisticated), machine learning-based meta-models that learn to predict which candidates are most likely to succeed experimentally, or other MCDM methods such as Analytic Hierarchy Process[34].

### Computational Infrastructure and Resource Requirements

Implementing this pipeline requires substantial computational resources. RFdiffusion design runs typically require GPU acceleration (NVIDIA A100 or equivalent) and will generate 50-100 designs per GPU-hour for mini-binder scaffolds[3][58]. Designing for 3-5 epitope regions with 50-100 designs each would require approximately 150-500 GPU-hours, feasible on high-performance computing clusters over the course of 1-2 weeks[3][58]. ProteinMPNN sequence generation is substantially faster, requiring 10-50 GPU-hours for generating sequences for 1000+ backbones[7][10].

AlphaFold 3 complex structure prediction requires substantial computational resources, with each prediction requiring multiple GPU-hours depending on system size and confidence level required[8][11]. Predicting structures for 1000+ binder-target complexes would require 1000-2000 GPU-hours, feasible on high-performance computing clusters over 2-4 weeks[8][11]. Rosetta binding energy calculations require substantial CPU resources (not GPU-intensive) and would require approximately 10-50 CPU-core-hours per design, for a total of 1000-5000 CPU-core-days across the top 100-200 candidates—feasible on computational clusters dedicated to molecular modeling[13][26][29].

Efficient implementation of the pipeline requires integration of these tools into an automated workflow, using workflow management systems such as Nextflow, Snakemake, or Apache Airflow to orchestrate the movement of data and intermediate results between different tools. Open-source implementations of RFdiffusion, ProteinMPNN, and AlphaFold 3 are available through academic and commercial channels, enabling deployment of the pipeline on institutional or commercial cloud computing infrastructure.

## Conclusion and Future Directions

The computational pipeline presented in this report provides a comprehensive, evidence-based strategy for discovering mini-binder proteins that selectively modulate TNF receptor signaling to address the TNFα–ΔNp63α axis in triple-negative breast cancer. By integrating recent advances in generative protein design (RFdiffusion), sequence-structure prediction (ProteinMPNN, AlphaFold 3), binding affinity estimation (Rosetta, machine learning), and multi-criteria decision-making (SMAA-TOPSIS), the pipeline enables systematic generation of high-quality candidate binders while minimizing reliance on expensive and time-consuming experimental screening. The explicit incorporation of biophysical constraints, off-target assessment, and pathway-bias considerations ensures that generated candidates are not only predicted to bind tightly to their intended targets but also likely to demonstrate favorable developability, specificity, and therapeutic mechanism.

Several critical considerations emerge from this comprehensive pipeline design that warrant emphasis for successful implementation. First, the quality of the input—particularly the definition of target epitopes and their functional relevance to the therapeutic hypothesis—is paramount; even the most sophisticated computational design cannot overcome suboptimal epitope selection. Accordingly, investment in careful structural analysis, literature review of related binders, and functional validation of epitope-signaling relationships is justified before commencing large-scale design. Second, the multiple uncertainty layers in computational prediction (structure prediction confidence, affinity estimation accuracy, kinetics prediction limitations) mean that high-throughput experimental validation remains essential; while the pipeline dramatically reduces the number of designs requiring testing (from tens of thousands with earlier methods to potentially <100 with RFdiffusion+AlphaFold 3), experimental characterization of the top candidates remains non-negotiable[3][6][8][11].

Third, the therapeutic complexity of the TNFα–ΔNp63α axis in TNBC demands careful mechanistic validation beyond simple binding affinity measurements. Cell-based assays examining TNFR1-specific signaling (NF-κB-responsive luciferase reporter assays, monitoring caspase activation, measuring p38 and JNK phosphorylation) and TNFR2-specific signaling (monitoring alternative NF-κB pathway activation via p100/p52 processing, evaluating effects on MDSC survival and differentiation, assessing Treg induction) should be incorporated into the experimental validation strategy[5][21][51]. Competition assays verifying that designed binders do not interfere with essential TNF receptor functions in normal immune cells are also critical for safety assessment.

Fourth, the specificity of TNFR1 versus TNFR2 targeting remains a key design parameter with profound therapeutic implications. While the pipeline as presented can accommodate designs targeting either or both receptors, the explicit functional characterization of whether a given binder achieves TNFR1-selective antagonism, TNFR2-selective agonism, or dual engagement with differential effects on the two receptors is essential for mechanistic understanding and clinical translation[2][5].

Looking forward, several extensions to the described pipeline merit consideration. First, integration of structure-guided affinity maturation protocols into the ranking framework could enable prediction of which candidates are most likely to benefit from directed evolution toward higher affinity; designs predicted to have significant sequence space for affinity improvement might be preferred over designs already approaching fitness peaks[15][43]. Second, incorporation of pharmacokinetic property prediction (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion) into the MCDM framework could enable optimization not just for target engagement but for favorable in vivo exposure and clearance[31]. Third, multi-objective optimization across affinity, specificity, and immunogenicity simultaneously (rather than sequential optimization) might identify candidates that represent better overall compromises than the current approach[34].

In conclusion, the discovery of selective TNF receptor-targeting mini-binders represents a promising therapeutic strategy for TNBC that leverages recent computational advances to accelerate candidate identification while maintaining rigorous focus on mechanistic and safety considerations. The pipeline described herein provides a generalizable framework for therapeutic protein discovery that can be adapted to target additional inflammatory pathways, immune checkpoints, and other protein-protein interactions of therapeutic relevance. Successful implementation of this computational pipeline, coupled with rigorous experimental validation and cell-based mechanistic characterization, is anticipated to yield clinical candidates capable of meaningfully improving outcomes for TNBC patients through selective modulation of TNF receptor signaling and disruption of the TNFα–ΔNp63α oncogenic axis.
