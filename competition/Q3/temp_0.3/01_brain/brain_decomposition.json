  "original_problem_text": "Problem 3. [Identification of Next-Generation Antibody Targets to Overcome the Limitations of GLP-1R Agonists in Obesity Treatment]\n\n\nBackground\nGLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists have revolutionized the treatment of obesity, demonstrating unprecedented efficacy in body weight reduction. However, their clinical use is associated with significant limitations, including gastrointestinal adverse effects, nausea and vomiting, and loss of lean muscle mass. Moreover, GLP-1–based therapies do not fully address the complex compensatory physiological and metabolic pathways that counteract sustained weight loss.\nNext-generation obesity therapeutics aim to go beyond simple weight reduction and instead focus on improving overall metabolic health while minimizing adverse effects. Achieving this goal requires a deeper understanding of the mechanistic limitations of GLP-1 signaling and the identification of novel therapeutic targets that can synergize with or complement GLP-1–based interventions.\n\nTask\nAnalyze the mechanistic and clinical limitations of GLP-1R agonists and propose next-generation antibody-based therapeutic targets that could overcome these limitations.\n1) Analysis of Limitations and Compensatory Pathways of GLP-1–Based Obesity Therapies\n•\tIdentify the major clinical and mechanistic limitations of GLP-1R agonists\n•\tAnalyze compensatory physiological and metabolic pathways linked to GLP-1 signaling\n•\tPropose key compensatory nodes that are:\no\tFunctionally relevant to obesity and metabolic regulation\no\tNot sufficiently suppressed or modulated by GLP-1 alone\n2) Proposal of Next-Generation Antibody Targets and Therapeutic Strategies\nBased on your analysis:\n•\tPropose two novel therapeutic targets that could:\no\tAct in mechanistic synergy with GLP-1\no\tOr complement GLP-1 signaling to mitigate its limitations\n•\tJustify target selection based on:\no\tBiological function\no\tPathway context\no\tExpected impact on metabolic health and side-effect reduction\nFor each proposed target:\n•\tSpecify the antibody modality (e.g., IgG, VHH, bispecific, combination therapy)\n•\tDescribe the therapeutic strategy (e.g., GLP-1R agonist + novel antibody combination)\n•\tDiscuss:\no\tExpected improvements over GLP-1 monotherapy\no\tPotential risks, trade-offs, or safety considerations\n\n",

      "description": "Compile the major clinical limitations of GLP-1R agonists in obesity (e.g., GI adverse effects, nausea/vomiting, lean mass loss, discontinuation/rebound, heterogeneity of response). Map these limitations to mechanistic drivers (CNS/brainstem nausea circuitry, gastric emptying, bile acid signaling, autonomic effects, food reward, energy expenditure adaptation, muscle protein turnover). Analyze compensatory physiological and metabolic pathways that counteract sustained weight loss during GLP-1 therapy (e.g., adaptive thermogenesis, increased appetite signaling, hormonal counter-regulation, neuroendocrine adaptations, changes in glucagon/cortisol/thyroid axes, adipose tissue remodeling/inflammation). From this analysis, propose key compensatory nodes that (i) are functionally relevant to obesity/metabolic regulation and (ii) are not sufficiently suppressed/modulated by GLP-1 alone, prioritizing nodes that are antibody-addressable (cell-surface receptors, circulating ligands, checkpoint-like endocrine factors).",
      "suggested_approach": "Literature-first mechanistic synthesis: (1) Systematically review RCTs/real-world evidence for GLP-1RA adverse events, discontinuation, and body composition outcomes; extract patterns by molecule/dose/time (terms: semaglutide, liraglutide, tirzepatide, GI tolerability, nausea, vomiting, gastric emptying, lean mass, sarcopenia). (2) Build a pathway map linking GLP-1R signaling to downstream nodes across CNS (hypothalamus/brainstem), gut, pancreas, liver, adipose, and skeletal muscle; explicitly annotate which nodes are direct GLP-1-mediated vs secondary. (3) Identify compensatory adaptations using systems biology framing (energy intake vs expenditure; neuroendocrine counter-regulation; adipose-muscle crosstalk). (4) Prioritize compensatory nodes using criteria: human genetics support (GWAS/MR if available), tissue expression/cell-type specificity (single-cell atlases), druggability by antibodies (secreted ligands/receptors), predicted safety liabilities (on-target risks), and complementarity to GLP-1 (orthogonal mechanism vs additive appetite suppression). Produce a ranked list of candidate compensatory nodes with rationale and evidence strength.",

      "title": "Propose Two Next-Generation Antibody Targets and Combination/Bispecific Strategies with GLP-1",
      "description": "Select two novel therapeutic targets (antigen-level) that could mechanistically synergize with GLP-1 or complement GLP-1 to mitigate its limitations. For each target: justify selection via biological function, pathway context, and expected impact on metabolic health and side-effect reduction (including GI tolerability and lean mass preservation). Specify the antibody modality (e.g., IgG antagonist/agonist, VHH, bispecific, antibody-cytokine fusion, long-acting ligand trap, combination therapy) and define a therapeutic strategy (e.g., GLP-1RA + antibody co-therapy; GLP-1/antibody co-formulation; bispecific engaging GLP-1 pathway plus target). Discuss expected improvements over GLP-1 monotherapy and articulate key risks/trade-offs/safety considerations (immune effects, cardiovascular risk, hypoglycemia risk, GI motility, neuropsychiatric signals, muscle/bone effects).",
      "suggested_approach": "Target-to-therapy design workflow (strategic, not experimental execution): (1) From Sub-problem 1 ranked nodes, shortlist antibody-suitable targets (secreted ligands, endocrine factors, GPCR ectodomains, receptor-ligand pairs). (2) For each proposed target, define desired mechanism (blockade vs agonism vs ligand trapping) and why it complements GLP-1 (e.g., reduces nausea pathway activation, preserves lean mass/anabolism, improves insulin sensitivity/lipid handling, counters adaptive thermogenesis, reduces hedonic eating). (3) Choose modality by pharmacology and biology: IgG for ligand/receptor blockade; VHH for CNS-penetrance or gut-restricted designs (if intended); bispecific if dual pathway coordination is required; combination if dose titration is important for safety. (4) Develop an anticipated benefit-risk profile: differentiate on-target vs off-target risks, tissue distribution considerations, and monitoring biomarkers (e.g., body composition metrics, resting energy expenditure, gastric emptying proxies, liver fat, inflammatory markers). (5) Provide a concise go/no-go rationale per target (evidence strength, translational feasibility, differentiation vs existing incretin/polyagonist landscape).",
