# Next-Generation Antibody Therapeutics to Overcome Mechanistic and Clinical Limitations of GLP-1 Receptor Agonists in Obesity Treatment

## Executive Summary

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists have fundamentally transformed obesity pharmacotherapy by achieving unprecedented weight loss of 15 to 25 percent on average within one year[3]. However, their clinical adoption and sustained efficacy are limited by multiple interrelated factors: pronounced gastrointestinal adverse effects such as nausea (21.49% incidence), vomiting (9.10%), and diarrhea (10.62%)[1]; significant losses of lean muscle mass comprising 40 to 60 percent of total weight lost in some cohorts[2]; and the emergence of compensatory physiological adaptations that drive weight plateauing and rapid rebound following treatment discontinuation, with two-thirds of lost weight regained within one year after cessation[37]. These limitations reflect both direct mechanistic constraints of GLP-1 signaling—particularly its activation of brainstem nausea circuitry and its effects on gastric motility—and insufficiently addressed compensatory pathways spanning neuroendocrine counter-regulation, adaptive thermogenesis, and hedonic eating circuitry. Here we present a comprehensive mechanistic analysis of GLP-1R agonist limitations and propose two synergistic antibody-based therapeutic targets designed to complement and enhance GLP-1 signaling while mitigating its most clinically significant adverse effects and metabolic constraints. The first proposed target, growth and differentiation factor 15 (GDF15), presents an opportunity to reduce GLP-1-mediated nausea by antagonizing nausea-promoting pathways in the area postrema while potentially enhancing metabolic adaptation and reducing inflammation. The second target, fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), addresses the critical limitation of adaptive thermogenesis and lean mass preservation by activating adipose tissue browning, increasing energy expenditure independent of GLP-1 signaling, and improving hepatic and metabolic homeostasis. Both targets offer mechanistic synergy with GLP-1 signaling while addressing distinct therapeutic gaps, with well-characterized antibody-addressable biology and preliminary clinical evidence supporting their metabolic benefits in combination with incretin-based therapies.

## Mechanistic and Clinical Limitations of GLP-1 Receptor Agonists

### Gastrointestinal Adverse Effects and Central Nausea Circuitry

The most frequently reported and clinically significant adverse events associated with GLP-1R agonism are gastrointestinal symptoms, with nausea being the predominant complaint, affecting up to 50 percent of patients in early treatment phases[4]. Among all gastrointestinal adverse events documented in a comprehensive meta-analysis of 48 randomized controlled trials encompassing 27,729 participants, the overall incidence reached 11.66 percent, with specific event rates of nausea at 21.49 percent, diarrhea at 10.62 percent, vomiting at 9.10 percent, dyspepsia at 8.67 percent, constipation at 7.92 percent, and decreased appetite at 5.49 percent[1]. Critically, the nature and severity of these adverse effects display marked heterogeneity across different GLP-1R agonist molecules and formulations. Short-acting GLP-1RAs such as lixisenatide and exenatide carry significantly higher risks of nausea and vomiting compared to long-acting agents like dulaglutide and semaglutide, with exenatide demonstrating the highest incidence of nausea at 31.70 percent and vomiting, while tirzepatide, the dual GLP-1R/glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptor agonist, exhibits the highest overall risk of nausea and diarrhea among currently available agents[1]. In some cases, nausea and vomiting have directly precipitated treatment discontinuation in up to 4 percent of patients in clinical trials, thereby compromising therapeutic outcomes[4].

The mechanistic basis for GLP-1-induced nausea involves activation of the area postrema, a circumventricular organ located in the hindbrain that lacks a complete blood-brain barrier and is therefore directly accessible to circulating GLP-1R agonists[10][13][16]. The area postrema contains heterogeneous neuronal populations that mediate nausea and related visceral malaise responses. Specifically, a subset of excitatory neurons expressing the growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) receptor (GFRAL), designated cluster 4, express GLP-1 receptors (GLP-1R) and are activated by GLP-1R agonists[13]. Upon activation by GLP-1R agonists, these neurons promote flavor avoidance, nausea-associated behaviors, and conditioned taste aversion responses that parallel poisoning responses to visceral toxins[13]. Genetic ablation or inhibitory modulation of these GLP-1R-expressing, GFRAL-positive neurons in the area postrema eliminates GLP-1R agonist-induced nausea and flavor avoidance while preserving appetite-suppressive effects mediated through parallel nuclei tractus solitarius (NTS) circuits, indicating functional segregation between nausea and satiation pathways[13][10].

The temporal pattern of GLP-1-induced nausea further illuminates the mechanistic constraint: short-acting GLP-1RAs produce higher peak plasma concentrations that coincide with maximal receptor occupancy in the area postrema, triggering abrupt activation of nausea circuitry; in contrast, long-acting formulations produce sustained, lower-amplitude GLP-1R signaling that permits neural adaptation, including potential tachyphylaxis to nausea signals, thereby reducing symptom severity despite equivalent cumulative receptor activation over time[4]. This temporal sensitivity indicates that nausea emerges from a specific circuit configuration—rapid, supraphysiological GLP-1R activation in nausea-promoting brainstem neurons—rather than from GLP-1R engagement per se. Moreover, the fact that such high proportions of patients experience nausea suggests that the nausea circuitry is substantially more sensitive to GLP-1R agonism than satiation circuits, creating a therapeutic window constraint.

### Gastrointestinal Dysmotility and Complicating Factors

Beyond direct CNS effects, GLP-1R agonism slows gastric emptying via peripheral GLP-1R activation on vagal afferent neurons and enteric neurons, leading to delayed nutrient transit and reduced gastric mechanoreceptor signaling[10]. While delayed gastric emptying contributes to satiation and reduced meal size, it also predisposes to gastrointestinal stasis, reduced nutrient absorption efficiency, and secondary gastrointestinal symptoms including bloating, dyspepsia, and diarrhea[1][4]. Critically, prolonged or severe nausea and vomiting secondary to GLP-1R agonism can precipitate pre-renal acute kidney injury through volume depletion and reduced renal perfusion, with documented case reports linking exenatide administration to acute kidney injury in approximately 100 reported cases, predominantly attributed to gastrointestinal fluid losses rather than direct nephrotoxicity[4]. This adverse cascade illustrates how compensatory physiological responses to GLP-1R agonism can create clinical complications that extend far beyond the intended therapeutic target.

### Lean Muscle Mass Loss and Sarcopenic Risk

A second major clinical concern emerging from systematic analysis of GLP-1R agonist trials is the substantial loss of lean body mass accompanying weight reduction. Heterogeneity in reported lean mass changes reflects both true biological variation and differences in measurement methodology, as lean mass encompasses not only skeletal muscle but also organs, bone, water, and fluid within adipose tissue[2]. Nevertheless, pooled evidence from both magnetic resonance imaging-based studies and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) analyses demonstrates that in some studies, reductions in lean mass account for 40 to 60 percent of total weight lost, while in others this proportion falls to approximately 15 percent or less[2]. This heterogeneity appears linked to multiple factors including patient age, baseline metabolic status, disease severity, and the presence of comorbidities such as sarcopenia risk, which emerge as modifying factors in determining whether lean mass is preserved or disproportionately lost[2].

The mechanistic basis for lean mass loss during GLP-1R agonism involves multiple overlapping pathways. First, GLP-1R signaling suppresses energy intake more potently than it increases energy expenditure, resulting in a substantial negative energy balance that the body preferentially mobilizes from muscle due to the metabolic efficiency of adipose tissue as an energy reservoir[3][8]. Second, GLP-1R agonists reduce non-resting energy expenditure (NREE)—the energy cost of movement and physical activity—by approximately 170 kilocalories per day even with modest weight loss of only 2 kilograms[8]. This reduction in NREE appears mechanistically linked to increased muscle work efficiency and reduced spontaneous physical activity, representing a form of adaptive thermogenesis[8]. Third, the loss of anabolic signals to skeletal muscle, including reduced meal-stimulated amino acid availability and diminished postprandial insulin secretion, can impair muscle protein synthesis despite adequate protein intake[2][34]. Fourth, weight loss-induced mechanical unloading of the musculoskeletal system reduces gravitational stress on muscle, contributing to disuse atrophy and suppressing compensatory hypertrophy signals[5]. Collectively, these mechanisms create a substantial risk for sarcopenia, particularly in older adults and those with pre-existing muscle wasting, in whom muscle loss may exceed adaptive thresholds and result in functional decline[2][5].

### Weight Regain and Failure of Sustained Metabolic Adaptation

A defining characteristic of GLP-1R agonist therapy is the rapid and substantial weight regain following treatment discontinuation. In the STEP 1 extension trial examining post-treatment weight trajectory, participants regained two-thirds of their prior weight loss within one year after discontinuing semaglutide, despite continuing lifestyle interventions[37]. This phenomenon reflects the fundamental limitation that GLP-1R agonists do not achieve permanent neurophysiological or metabolic reprogramming; rather, they impose a temporary suppression of appetite and energy intake that, upon withdrawal, allows rapid reinstatement of pre-treatment compensatory responses.

The mechanistic underpinning of weight regain involves multiple layers of biological counter-regulation. During active weight loss on GLP-1R agonists, circulating levels of orexigenic hormones including ghrelin increase while anorectic hormones including leptin, peptide YY (PYY), cholecystokinin (CCK), and endogenous GLP-1 decrease[6]. These hormonal alterations persist even after substantial (10 percent or greater) weight loss and can be documented one year after the initial weight loss intervention, suggesting that body weight is regulated around a defended set point that remains elevated despite external GLP-1R agonist administration[6]. Upon treatment cessation, these compensatory hormonal signals become unopposed, driving rapid hunger and hyperphagia that reverses the weight loss achieved.

Additionally, adaptive thermogenesis—a reduction in total energy expenditure greater than would be predicted from changes in body composition—emerges as a critical limiting factor[8][11][12]. During active weight loss, the body downregulates its metabolic rate through suppression of sympathetic nervous system activity and the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis, leading to a 8.2 to 11.1 kilocalorie per day per kilogram of fat-free mass reduction in total energy expenditure[8]. This adaptive thermogenesis may be partially independent of weight loss magnitude and appears mechanistically linked to reduced calcium futile cycling in skeletal muscle and increased muscle work efficiency[8]. The non-resting component of energy expenditure (NREE), which includes the energy cost of structured exercise and spontaneous physical activity, accounts for 62.2 to 71.9 percent of the total energy expenditure reduction during weight loss, and GLP-1R agonists appear to amplify this reduction independent of their effects on body composition[8]. Upon treatment cessation, this adaptive suppression of energy expenditure may persist for months to years, creating a metabolic environment in which weight regain is thermodynamically favored even in the absence of excessive caloric intake[11][12].

### Heterogeneity of Response and Metabolic Resistance

A fourth critical limitation is the substantial heterogeneity of weight loss response among individuals treated with identical GLP-1R agonist doses, with some patients achieving 20 to 25 percent body weight reduction while others lose only 5 to 10 percent or even fail to respond[1][2][25]. This heterogeneity appears partially explained by baseline patient characteristics including age, body mass index (BMI), renal function, and comorbidities, as well as by differential GLP-1R expression across hypothalamic and brainstem nuclei[1]. Additionally, metabolic factors including baseline insulin sensitivity, inflammatory status, and adipose tissue function appear to predict treatment response[2]. Some data suggest that individuals with severe obesity may exhibit reduced sensitivity to GLP-1R agonist effects on appetite suppression, possibly related to chronic GLP-1 resistance or downregulation of GLP-1R signaling in key metabolic tissues[2]. This heterogeneity creates a clinical challenge: some patients derive maximal benefit from GLP-1R agonists, while others require higher doses or adjunctive therapies to achieve clinically meaningful weight loss, yet current clinical practice often employs a one-size-fits-all dosing approach.

## Compensatory Physiological and Metabolic Pathways That Counteract Sustained Weight Loss

### Appetite-Regulating Hormone Adaptations and Neuroendocrine Counter-Regulation

Beyond acute suppression of hunger and food intake, GLP-1R agonists engage a complex neuroendocrine landscape characterized by compensatory adaptations that progressively reduce treatment efficacy. The hypothalamus integrates multiple hormonal signals including leptin (an adiposity signal indicating energy stores), ghrelin (an orexigenic signal from the stomach), GLP-1 and peptide YY (anorectic incretins from the gut), and insulin (reflecting glycemic and nutrient status)[6][9]. During diet-induced weight loss, leptin levels decline more steeply than can be explained by weight loss alone, suggesting enhanced leptin sensitivity or increased clearance[6]. Simultaneously, ghrelin levels increase substantially, creating a potent orexigenic drive that persists long-term and appears refractory to GLP-1R agonist suppression in the context of sustained weight loss[6]. Moreover, the interaction between GLP-1 and ghrelin signaling reveals bidirectional antagonism: GLP-1R activation potently suppresses ghrelin secretion and reduces ghrelin's actions on appetite neurons, yet prolonged GLP-1R agonism may paradoxically upregulate ghrelin signaling in response to the sustained energy deficit[6][9]. This compensatory upregulation of ghrelin appears mediated through altered vagal afferent signaling and changes in gut microbiota composition following altered nutrient transit and absorption[6].

Another critical compensatory pathway involves changes in dopamine signaling in reward circuits. Recent evidence demonstrates that ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine neurons encode food palatability and specifically control the consummatory (eating) phase of feeding through sustained elevation of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens (NAc)[32][35]. Crucially, GLP-1R agonist activation suppresses VTA dopamine neuron responsiveness during food consumption, thus reducing hedonic eating drive[32][35]. However, with repeated GLP-1R agonist exposure, dopamine neurons recover their responsiveness to palatable food cues, potentially through desensitization or compensatory upregulation of inhibitory circuits, thereby permitting renewed hedonic eating and appetitive behavior despite continued GLP-1R agonist administration[35]. This dopamine-mediated hedonic pathway may explain why some patients experience progressive loss of appetite suppression over months of treatment—a phenomenon termed tachyphylaxis—despite unchanged GLP-1R agonist doses[40].

### Metabolic Adaptation, Adaptive Thermogenesis, and Suppressed Energy Expenditure

The most consequential compensatory pathway limiting sustained weight loss is metabolic adaptation, operationalized as a reduction in total energy expenditure (TEE) that exceeds what would be predicted from losses of lean and fat mass[8][11][12]. This adaptive thermogenesis appears mechanistically driven by suppression of sympathetic nervous system (SNS) tone and hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis activity during the energy deficit imposed by GLP-1R agonist administration[11][12]. Specifically, as fat stores deplete and energy deficit signals accumulate, the body downregulates catecholamine sensitivity and thyroid hormone production, creating a "thrifty" metabolic state that minimizes further energy loss[11][12]. This adaptive response appears mechanistically linked to reduced calcium futile cycling in skeletal muscle, reflecting increased metabolic efficiency of muscular work[8]. The magnitude of adaptive thermogenesis varies substantially among individuals and appears partially independent of the magnitude of weight loss, suggesting underlying heterogeneity in metabolic flexibility or adaptive capacity.

Importantly, this adaptive suppression of TEE persists during the weight-reduced state, implying that GLP-1R agonists do not prevent or overcome metabolic adaptation but rather superimpose their appetite-suppressive effects upon an ongoing metabolic adaptation process[8][11][12]. Upon treatment cessation, this persisting metabolic adaptation creates a state of thermodynamic favorability for rapid fat regain: the body maintains a suppressed metabolic rate despite reduced energy intake, thereby creating a substantial negative energy balance upon discontinuation that forces rapid repletion of energy stores through hyperphagia[11][12][40]. This metabolic constraint appears particularly problematic for sustained weight loss maintenance, as it explains why even well-motivated patients with strong behavioral support regain weight rapidly after GLP-1R agonist withdrawal.

### Adipose Tissue Remodeling, Inflammatory Adaptations, and Impaired Insulin Sensitivity

Weight loss induced by GLP-1R agonism triggers substantial remodeling of adipose tissue, including changes in adipocyte size, extracellular matrix composition, immune cell infiltration, and inflammatory signaling[1][3]. While acute weight loss typically reduces adipose tissue inflammation and improves local and systemic insulin sensitivity[3], prolonged weight loss may paradoxically trigger compensatory inflammatory responses. Specifically, adipose tissue macrophages exhibit polarization from the M1 (pro-inflammatory) phenotype toward the M2 (anti-inflammatory) phenotype during early weight loss, but sustained weight loss can reverse this polarization as adipose tissue senses the threat of energy store depletion and upregulates inflammatory signals to promote energy conservation and appetite drive[29][38]. Additionally, reduced leptin secretion from weight-lost adipocytes fails to sustain anti-inflammatory signaling to immune cells, potentially permitting rebound M1 macrophage accumulation and systemic inflammation upon treatment cessation[29][38].

Furthermore, the loss of adipose-derived endocrine signals including adiponectin and fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) during weight loss compromises the metabolic benefits of weight reduction. Adiponectin levels decline with weight loss, reducing systemic anti-inflammatory signaling and impairing the improvements in hepatic and muscle insulin sensitivity that occur acutely during weight loss[3]. Similarly, FGF21 levels decline despite increased circulating levels of free fatty acids, suggesting FGF21 resistance or metabolic counter-regulation that impairs the metabolic advantages of weight loss[27][30][46]. This loss of adipokine signaling appears particularly consequential for muscle glucose utilization: reduced adiponectin and FGF21 signaling impairs insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in skeletal muscle, thereby reducing the metabolic flexibility that would otherwise sustain improved insulin sensitivity during weight loss[31].

## Proposed Compensatory Nodes Addressable by Next-Generation Antibody Therapeutics

From the above mechanistic analysis, we identify several compensatory nodes that are inadequately addressed by GLP-1R agonism alone and represent promising targets for antibody-based therapeutics. The most relevant candidates that satisfy criteria of biological relevance to obesity and metabolic regulation, antibody addressability, and expected complementarity to GLP-1 signaling include: (1) the GDF15-GFRAL nausea axis, which mediates GLP-1-induced nausea through area postrema activation and represents a direct mechanistic liability; (2) fibroblast growth factor 21 and its receptor complex (FGFR1/β-Klotho), which directly addresses metabolic adaptation and lean mass preservation through enhanced energy expenditure; (3) amylin receptor signaling, which provides synergistic appetite suppression and GI motility slowing without inducing nausea; (4) peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) signaling and related adipokine pathways that mediate insulin sensitivity and brown adipose tissue activation; and (5) inflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), which appear to drive compensatory inflammatory responses that limit weight loss sustainability. Among these, we select GDF15 antagonism and FGF21 agonism as the two most promising next-generation antibody targets, as they directly address the two most clinically significant and mechanistically consequential limitations of GLP-1R agonists: nausea-mediated treatment discontinuation and metabolic adaptation-driven weight plateau and regain.

## Proposed Next-Generation Antibody Therapeutics: Target 1—GDF15 Antagonism to Reduce GLP-1-Induced Nausea

### Biological Rationale and Mechanistic Synergy

GDF15, also designated as macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1 (MIC-1), is a circulating pleiotropic cytokine that acts as a systemic alarm signal in response to cellular stress, malnutrition, and metabolic dysfunction[16][24]. The receptor for GDF15, GFRAL (GDF15 receptor, also designated RET family receptor for GDNF-like factor), is highly expressed in a specialized subset of area postrema neurons that mediate nausea and visceral malaise responses[13][16]. Importantly, GFRAL-expressing neurons in the area postrema constitute a subpopulation of GLP-1R-expressing excitatory neurons, such that GDF15 and GLP-1 can both activate overlapping neural populations, albeit through distinct mechanistic pathways[13][16]. The GFRAL-expressing cluster 4 neurons in the area postrema are directly inhibited by glucose-insulinotropic peptide (GIP) receptor agonism through GABAergic interneurons, explaining the reduced nausea observed with dual GLP-1R/GIPR agonists such as tirzepatide compared to GLP-1R monotherapy[15][7].

The therapeutic strategy of GDF15 antagonism leverages the observation that GFRAL-mediated signaling represents a distinct and antagonizable mechanism of nausea induction. While GLP-1R agonism activates GFRAL neurons directly, GDF15 antagonism would not eliminate the GLP-1-mediated component of nausea but would instead block the amplification and persistence of nausea signals through GFRAL-GFRAL interaction[7][16]. Biologically, during GLP-1R agonist treatment, elevated circulating GDF15 levels—which are increased in obesity and further elevated during caloric restriction and weight loss—would reinforce and sustain nausea signals initiated by GLP-1R activation[16][24]. By antagonizing GDF15-GFRAL signaling through a neutralizing antibody, the cumulative nausea signal would be reduced without necessarily eliminating the direct GLP-1R-mediated component, thereby permitting a shift in the dose-response curve of nausea that would allow higher or more frequent GLP-1R agonist doses without proportional increases in nausea severity.

### Proposed Antibody Modality and Therapeutic Strategy

We propose an anti-GDF15 monoclonal antibody (mAb) of the immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) isotype, engineered for serum half-life extension through modification of the Fc region (e.g., P329G N-glycosylation optimization or fusion to human serum albumin) to achieve a serum half-life of 3 to 4 weeks, permitting weekly or biweekly dosing aligned with GLP-1R agonist injection schedules[27][30]. The therapeutic strategy would employ combination therapy with a standard GLP-1R agonist (e.g., semaglutide 2.4 mg subcutaneously weekly) plus the anti-GDF15 mAb (e.g., 50 to 100 mg subcutaneously weekly or biweekly). Alternatively, given the mechanistic complementarity of GIP co-agonism in reducing GFRAL neuron activity[15][7], a trispecific antibody architecture engaging GLP-1R agonism, GIPR agonism, and GDF15 antagonism could theoretically achieve maximal nausea reduction with a single therapeutic entity; however, such complex engineering creates substantial translational risk and immunogenicity concerns, making the simpler combination approach more clinically feasible.

The anti-GDF15 mAb would employ a ligand-trapping mechanism, in which the antibody binds circulating GDF15 with high affinity and specificity, preventing its engagement of GFRAL on area postrema neurons[16][24][27][30]. This mechanism is distinct from conventional receptor antagonism and carries the advantage that it targets the ligand rather than the receptor, thus avoiding potential compensatory ligand upregulation that might occur with direct GFRAL antagonism. Preclinical validation of this approach exists in the form of GDF15 neutralization studies demonstrating reduced nausea and improved food intake in response to chemotherapy-induced nausea models and in response to caloric restriction in rodent models[16][24]. Moreover, systemic GDF15 elevation has been associated with cancer cachexia and anorexia, and GDF15 antagonism reverses these phenotypes through area postrema-mediated mechanisms[16][24].

### Expected Improvements Over GLP-1 Monotherapy

The predicted clinical benefit of GLP-1R agonist plus anti-GDF15 mAb combination therapy is a substantial reduction in nausea incidence and severity, thereby improving treatment adherence and permitting dose escalation beyond what would be tolerable with GLP-1R agonist monotherapy. Current evidence suggests that 20 to 30 percent of GLP-1R agonist-treated patients discontinue therapy due to gastrointestinal side effects[1][4], with nausea being the predominant reason[4]. By reducing nausea via GDF15 antagonism, a combination approach could potentially retain 10 to 15 percent of patients who would otherwise discontinue, thereby improving population-level weight loss outcomes. Additionally, if the reduced nausea permits higher GLP-1R agonist doses than are currently tolerable, the magnitude of weight loss could increase from 15 to 25 percent (current range with semaglutide monotherapy at 2.4 mg weekly) to potentially 20 to 30 percent, approaching the efficacy of surgical interventions[3].

Secondary benefits of GDF15 antagonism may include modest improvements in energy expenditure and metabolic rate during weight loss. GDF15 itself can suppress feeding and energy expenditure through area postrema-mediated mechanisms independent of GLP-1R signaling, and elevated GDF15 during caloric restriction may contribute to adaptive thermogenesis[16][24]. By antagonizing GDF15, a combination therapy might modestly reduce the adaptive suppression of energy expenditure during weight loss, thereby improving the sustainability of weight loss and reducing the rate of weight regain upon treatment cessation. However, this benefit is predicted to be modest (5 to 10 percent attenuation of adaptive thermogenesis) because GLP-1R agonists appear to drive metabolic adaptation through multiple independent mechanisms beyond GDF15 signaling[8].

### Potential Risks, Trade-Offs, and Safety Considerations

Several potential safety concerns merit careful consideration. First, GDF15 itself appears to play important physiological roles in response to cellular stress, and systemic neutralization could impair adaptive responses to infection, inflammation, or severe illness[16][24]. Specifically, GDF15 elevation during viral or bacterial infection may represent an important endocrine alarm that coordinates immune responses and metabolic adaptation to infection, and GDF15 antagonism could theoretically impair these adaptive responses[16][24]. Preclinical and early clinical evidence suggests this risk is modest, as GDF15 knockout mice do not show marked immunodeficiency, but careful monitoring of infection rates would be warranted in clinical trials[16].

Second, GDF15 has been shown to promote lipolysis and reduce hepatic steatosis through GFRAL-independent mechanisms in some tissues, and GDF15 antagonism could theoretically impair fat oxidation and permit hepatic lipid accumulation[16][24][30]. However, this concern is likely minimal given that GLP-1R agonism itself substantially increases fat oxidation and reduces hepatic steatosis through mechanisms that do not depend on GDF15[3], and the combination therapy would be expected to retain the hepatic-protective effects of GLP-1R agonism.

Third, GDF15 has been implicated in bone metabolism and may play a role in bone resorption suppression during caloric restriction[16][24]. Since GLP-1R agonists already increase bone resorption and reduce bone mineral density during weight loss, GDF15 antagonism could theoretically exacerbate bone loss[39]. However, this concern must be weighed against the fact that GDF15 appears to mediate cancer cachexia-associated bone loss rather than protective bone effects, suggesting that GDF15 antagonism should not substantially worsen weight loss-associated bone loss. Monitoring of bone turnover markers and bone mineral density would be warranted in clinical trials.

Fourth, and perhaps most importantly, GDF15 is one of multiple nausea-inducing signals, and GDF15 antagonism alone may incompletely resolve GLP-1-induced nausea. The area postrema contains multiple excitatory neuron types expressing distinct receptors for nausea-inducing stimuli, including the GLP-1 receptor itself, the GFRAL (GDF15 receptor), and the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR)[13]. While GDF15 antagonism would attenuate signaling through one such pathway, the direct GLP-1R activation of GFRAL-expressing neurons would persist, potentially maintaining a residual nausea signal. This limitation suggests that GDF15 antagonism would optimally be combined with either direct GIP co-agonism (which inhibits GFRAL neurons through GABAergic interneurons) or direct GFRAL antagonism, requiring more complex polypharmacy or polyagent engineering. Nevertheless, preclinical data suggest that GDF15 antagonism combined with GIPR agonism could yield additive or synergistic nausea reduction[15][7], and such a combination represents a rational next step in antibody therapeutic development.

## Proposed Next-Generation Antibody Therapeutics: Target 2—FGF21 Agonism to Address Metabolic Adaptation and Preserve Lean Mass

### Biological Rationale and Mechanistic Synergy

Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is an endocrine hormone predominantly produced by the liver and adipose tissue in response to metabolic stress, nutrient deprivation, and caloric restriction[17][27][30][46]. FGF21 binds to a heteromeric receptor complex composed of fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) and the obligate co-receptor β-Klotho (KLB), activating downstream signaling through extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK), and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathways[17][27][30]. The biological effects of FGF21 include increases in energy expenditure mediated by brown and beige adipose tissue activation and enhanced uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) expression; reductions in hepatic lipogenesis and intrahepatic triglyceride content; improvements in systemic insulin sensitivity independent of weight loss through enhanced muscle glucose uptake; and anti-inflammatory effects mediated by reductions in circulating proinflammatory cytokines and increased adiponectin secretion[17][27][30][46].

Critically, while FGF21 levels increase in response to caloric restriction and weight loss, this elevation appears insufficient to overcome metabolic adaptation in the setting of sustained energy deficit[27][30][46]. This inadequacy manifests as "FGF21 resistance," a state in which elevated circulating FGF21 levels fail to produce expected metabolic benefits, appearing analogous to leptin resistance in obesity[27][30][46]. FGF21 resistance is mechanistically linked to reduced expression of FGFR1 and β-Klotho in adipose tissue during obesity and caloric restriction, creating a functional decoupling between elevated circulating FGF21 and downstream signaling capacity in target tissues[27][30][46]. Notably, interventions that restore FGFR1/β-Klotho expression—including exercise, certain PPARγ agonists, and specific dietary interventions—partially restore FGF21 responsiveness and improve metabolic outcomes[27][30][46]. This observation suggests that pharmacologically enhancing FGF21 signaling capacity beyond the endogenous FGF21 elevation during weight loss could overcome metabolic adaptation and improve the sustainability of weight loss.

The mechanistic basis for FGF21's benefit in the context of GLP-1R agonist therapy resides in its orthogonal effects on energy expenditure. While GLP-1R agonists suppress energy intake and may increase non-resting energy expenditure through altered dopamine-mediated hedonic eating, they do not prevent, and may actually exacerbate, metabolic adaptation characterized by suppressed basal metabolic rate and resting energy expenditure[8][12]. In contrast, FGF21 directly increases brown adipose tissue thermogenesis and whole-body energy expenditure through peripheral tissue-autonomous mechanisms that are mechanistically independent of GLP-1R signaling[17][27][30][46]. Thus, FGF21 agonism acts in mechanistic synergy with GLP-1R agonism, addressing the specific energetic component of weight loss that GLP-1R agonism does not substantially modify.

### Proposed Antibody Modality and Therapeutic Strategy

Rather than a conventional antagonist antibody, we propose an FGF21 receptor agonist antibody, a bispecific antibody that simultaneously engages FGFR1 and β-Klotho to activate the FGF21 signaling complex in a ligand-independent manner. This approach circumvents FGF21 resistance by directly activating the receptor complex regardless of endogenous FGF21 levels or receptor expression changes. Alternatively, because both FGFR1 and β-Klotho are well-characterized antibody targets, a conventional anti-FGFR1 agonist antibody combined with anti-β-Klotho co-stimulation could achieve similar functional outcomes with simpler manufacturing[27][30].

The therapeutic strategy would employ combination therapy of GLP-1R agonist plus anti-FGFR1/β-Klotho agonist antibody. For example, semaglutide 2.4 mg subcutaneously weekly would be combined with a bispecific FGFR1/β-Klotho agonist antibody (e.g., BFKB8488A or an analogous engineered antibody) dosed at 10 to 20 mg subcutaneously weekly or biweekly. The bispecific antibody would employ a bivalent architecture in which one arm engages FGFR1 with agonist activity (inducing conformational changes that permit FGFR kinase activation) and the second arm engages β-Klotho, creating a stabilized, activated FGFR1/β-Klotho complex that recruits and phosphorylates downstream signaling proteins[27][30]. Precedent for this approach exists in the form of the bispecific antibody BFKB8488A, which has been demonstrated in preclinical studies to induce weight loss in obese cynomolgus monkeys and early clinical studies to reduce body weight and improve cardiometabolic parameters in obese humans[30].

The anti-FGFR1/β-Klotho agonist antibody would directly engage and activate FGF21 receptor signaling independent of endogenous FGF21 levels, thereby bypassing FGF21 resistance and providing sustained FGFR1 activation throughout the dosing interval[27][30]. This mechanism is advantageous because it provides a pharmacologically predictable activation of the FGF21 pathway without the confounding effects of endogenous FGF21 regulation by the energy deficit itself.

### Expected Improvements Over GLP-1 Monotherapy

The predicted clinical benefits of GLP-1R agonist plus anti-FGFR1/β-Klotho agonist antibody combination therapy include several interconnected improvements. First, the direct activation of FGF21 signaling in brown adipose tissue and other tissues would increase whole-body energy expenditure independent of GLP-1R signaling, thereby partially offsetting the metabolic adaptation that occurs during weight loss[8][11][12][27][30]. Preclinical evidence suggests that FGF21 agonism increases energy expenditure by 5 to 15 percent in obese animal models, and clinical data with FGF21 analogs demonstrate similar effects in humans[27][30][46]. When combined with the energy intake reduction achieved by GLP-1R agonism, such an increase in energy expenditure would shift the energy balance equation substantially, enabling either greater sustained weight loss at equivalent caloric intake or maintenance of achieved weight loss at higher caloric intake (improved weight loss sustainability)[27][30][46].

Second, FGF21 agonism preserves or enhances lean muscle mass during weight loss through multiple mechanisms. FGF21 enhances systemic insulin sensitivity through direct activation of FGFR1 on skeletal muscle cells and through adipose tissue-mediated improvements in circulating adiponectin and reductions in circulating free fatty acids that would otherwise impair muscle glucose utilization[17][27][30][46]. Enhanced insulin sensitivity maintains postprandial insulin signaling to skeletal muscle, which is required for maximal protein synthesis and anabolic signaling through the mTORC1 pathway[31][34]. Furthermore, FGF21 directly increases circulating levels of adiponectin and reduces systemic inflammation through IL-6 and TNFα suppression, both of which contribute to improved muscle protein synthetic capacity[27][30]. Preclinical evidence demonstrates that FGF21 agonism combined with caloric restriction prevents the lean mass loss observed with caloric restriction alone in high-fat diet-fed mice[27][30]. If this benefit translates to humans, a combination therapy could substantially reduce sarcopenic risk compared to GLP-1R agonist monotherapy.

Third, FGF21 agonism improves hepatic metabolic health by reducing intrahepatic triglyceride content, activating hepatic mitochondrial oxidative metabolism, and suppressing hepatic de novo lipogenesis[17][27][30][46]. This benefit addresses a critical secondary outcome of obesity and GLP-1R agonist therapy, as many obese patients have non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) or non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) that predisposes to progressive fibrosis and cirrhosis. While GLP-1R agonists improve hepatic fat content through weight loss, FGF21 agonism would provide additional direct hepatic effects independent of weight loss magnitude[17][27][30][46].

Fourth, FGF21 agonism may reduce weight regain following treatment cessation. While GLP-1R agonism creates strong appetite suppression that can be rapidly reversed upon treatment withdrawal, FGF21 agonism increases energy expenditure through sustained activation of brown adipose tissue thermogenesis, which could persist at least partially for weeks to months after antibody treatment cessation due to the half-life of brown adipocyte transdifferentiation[27][30]. Thus, even after GLP-1R agonist discontinuation, FGF21-induced brown adipose tissue expansion and associated energy expenditure elevation might be sustained long enough to provide a therapeutic window for behavioral interventions to solidify weight loss maintenance.

### Potential Risks, Trade-Offs, and Safety Considerations

Several important safety considerations accompany FGF21 agonism. First, FGF21 signaling through FGFR1/β-Klotho activates multiple downstream pathways simultaneously, including not only the desired metabolic pathways (energy expenditure, insulin sensitization) but also potentially problematic pathways. FGFR signaling broadly can activate growth-promoting and mitogenic pathways in certain cell types, and sustained FGFR1 activation has been implicated in cell proliferation and fibrosis in some tissues[27][30]. While early clinical experience with FGF21 analogs has not revealed apparent cancer or fibrosis signals, longer-term and larger-scale clinical trials would be needed to definitively establish safety. Importantly, FGFR1 expression is relatively restricted to adipose and metabolic tissues, minimizing the risk of off-target growth stimulation in epithelial or hematopoietic tissues[27][30].

Second, FGF21 agonism appears to alter nutrient preference, promoting preference for carbohydrate and reducing preference for fat in rodent models and in early clinical data[17][27][30]. While this shift in macronutrient preference toward carbohydrate may be metabolically beneficial in the short-term context of weight loss (carbohydrate-preferential feeding is associated with greater satiety), long-term effects on dietary adherence and metabolic outcomes remain unclear. Preclinical data suggest that FGF21-induced shifts in carbohydrate preference are reversible upon FGF21 withdrawal, but human behavioral data are limited[27][30].

Third, FGF21 agonism activates both FGFR1 and FGFR3/4 to varying degrees depending on antibody or ligand specificity, and FGFR3 and FGFR4 activation has been associated with differential metabolic effects and potential adverse effects[27][30]. Careful antibody engineering to ensure selectivity for FGFR1/β-Klotho complexes while minimizing FGFR3/4 activation would be essential for clinical translation[27][30].

Fourth, and critically, FGF21 antagonism or withdrawal could theoretically permit rapid rebound hepatic steatosis or metabolic dysfunction if patients discontinue treatment without maintaining weight loss through other mechanisms[27][30][46]. Clinical trials would need to assess whether combination therapy with behavioral or dietary interventions provides sufficient weight loss maintenance to sustain metabolic benefits after treatment cessation[27][30].

Fifth, there is currently limited clinical experience with long-acting FGF21 agonist antibodies, and immunogenicity concerns may emerge in prolonged clinical use. However, anti-FGFR1/β-Klotho bispecific antibodies are being actively developed and have demonstrated acceptable tolerability in early clinical trials[30].

## Comparative Analysis and Integration of Proposed Targets

The two proposed next-generation antibody targets—GDF15 antagonism and FGF21 agonism—address mechanistically distinct and complementary limitations of GLP-1R agonist monotherapy. GDF15 antagonism directly addresses the most common reason for treatment discontinuation (nausea) and the most clinically problematic adverse effect, representing a mechanism to enable higher doses and improved adherence. FGF21 agonism addresses the more subtle but equally consequential limitation of metabolic adaptation and lean mass loss, representing a mechanism to improve the sustainability of weight loss and metabolic health outcomes.

Together, a triple-therapy approach combining GLP-1R agonism with GDF15 antagonism and FGF21 agonism would theoretically produce additive benefits: (1) higher doses of GLP-1R agonist tolerated due to reduced nausea; (2) greater sustained weight loss due to reduced metabolic adaptation; (3) preservation of lean muscle mass due to improved insulin sensitivity and reduced energy expenditure suppression; and (4) improved long-term weight loss maintenance due to sustained energy expenditure elevation. While such triple therapy introduces increased complexity and costs compared to GLP-1R agonist monotherapy, the potential benefits appear substantial enough to warrant clinical investigation, particularly in subpopulations at highest risk for GLP-1R agonist discontinuation or poor outcomes (e.g., older adults at risk for sarcopenia, patients with severe obesity refractory to standard GLP-1R agonists, patients with NAFLD).

## Clinical Development and Translational Pathway

The development of the proposed GDF15 antagonist plus GLP-1R agonist and FGF21 agonist plus GLP-1R agonist combinations would proceed through standard clinical trial phases. For the GDF15 antagonist combination, a Phase 1b dose-escalation study in obese volunteers would establish the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of the anti-GDF15 monoclonal antibody across a range of doses (10 to 100 mg intravenously or subcutaneously) combined with a fixed standard dose of GLP-1R agonist (semaglutide 2.4 mg weekly). Primary endpoints would include adverse event frequency and severity, with specific attention to nausea/vomiting incidence, gastric emptying parameters (measured by standardized gastric emptying scintigraphy), and body weight change. Secondary endpoints would include GDF15 receptor occupancy (measured by flow cytometry or PET imaging if GFRAL ligand availability permits), changes in circulating GDF15 levels, and biomarkers of lipid metabolism and inflammation. A Phase 2a proof-of-concept study would then randomize 100 to 150 obese volunteers to receive semaglutide 2.4 mg weekly plus anti-GDF15 antibody versus semaglutide 2.4 mg weekly plus placebo over 12 weeks, with coprimary endpoints of nausea incidence reduction (hypothesized 30 to 40 percent relative reduction) and weight loss magnitude. Successful Phase 2a results would support advancement to Phase 2b/3 trials examining dosing regimens and patient populations most likely to benefit.

Similarly, for the FGF21 agonist combination, a Phase 1b dose-escalation study would assess the safety and pharmacokinetics of anti-FGFR1/β-Klotho agonist antibody across a range of doses (1 to 50 mg intravenously or subcutaneously) combined with semaglutide 2.4 mg weekly, with specific attention to potential mitogenic or fibrotic signals. A Phase 2a proof-of-concept study (12 weeks, 100 to 150 participants) would compare semaglutide 2.4 mg weekly plus anti-FGFR1/β-Klotho agonist versus semaglutide 2.4 mg weekly plus placebo, with coprimary endpoints of resting energy expenditure preservation (hypothesized 10 to 20 percent less metabolic adaptation relative to placebo) and lean body mass retention (measured by DXA or MRI; hypothesized 50 percent reduction in lean mass loss relative to GLP-1R agonist monotherapy). Secondary endpoints would include weight loss magnitude, body composition, insulin sensitivity (HOMA-IR, glucose clamp), liver fat content (MRI-proton density fat fraction), lipid profiles, and safety biomarkers.

## Conclusion

GLP-1 receptor agonists have fundamentally transformed obesity treatment through their unprecedented efficacy in weight reduction; however, multiple mechanistic and clinical limitations—including gastrointestinal adverse effects driving treatment discontinuation, lean muscle mass loss predisposing to sarcopenia and functional decline, and compensatory metabolic adaptations permitting rapid weight regain—underscore the inadequacy of GLP-1R agonism as a monotherapy for sustained obesity management. We propose that next-generation obesity therapeutics must address these specific mechanistic limitations through synergistic combination approaches rather than incremental improvements in GLP-1R agonist dosing or formulation. Two particularly promising antibody-based targets emerge from mechanistic analysis: GDF15 antagonism, which directly reduces nausea through modulation of brainstem circuitry and thereby enables higher GLP-1R agonist doses and improved adherence; and FGF21 agonism, which directly increases energy expenditure, preserves lean muscle mass, and improves long-term weight loss sustainability through mechanisms mechanistically orthogonal to GLP-1R signaling. Clinical development of GLP-1R agonist plus anti-GDF15 monoclonal antibody and GLP-1R agonist plus anti-FGFR1/β-Klotho agonist antibody combinations represents a rational next step in obesity pharmacotherapy, with the potential to substantially improve both the efficacy and safety profile of GLP-1-based obesity treatment.
