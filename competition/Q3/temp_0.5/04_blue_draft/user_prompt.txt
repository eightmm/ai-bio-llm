Problem 3. [Identification of Next-Generation Antibody Targets to Overcome the Limitations of GLP-1R Agonists in Obesity Treatment]


Background
GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists have revolutionized the treatment of obesity, demonstrating unprecedented efficacy in body weight reduction. However, their clinical use is associated with significant limitations, including gastrointestinal adverse effects, nausea and vomiting, and loss of lean muscle mass. Moreover, GLP-1–based therapies do not fully address the complex compensatory physiological and metabolic pathways that counteract sustained weight loss.
Next-generation obesity therapeutics aim to go beyond simple weight reduction and instead focus on improving overall metabolic health while minimizing adverse effects. Achieving this goal requires a deeper understanding of the mechanistic limitations of GLP-1 signaling and the identification of novel therapeutic targets that can synergize with or complement GLP-1–based interventions.

# Next-Generation Antibody Therapeutics for Obesity: Overcoming GLP-1R Agonist Limitations Through Mechanistic Synergy and Compensatory Pathway Targeting

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists have fundamentally transformed the therapeutic landscape of obesity management, achieving weight loss outcomes that rival bariatric surgery in magnitude and sustainability[1][3]. However, accumulating clinical experience and mechanistic research have revealed substantial limitations that constrain the clinical utility and patient acceptability of these agents. Gastrointestinal adverse events, particularly nausea and vomiting, drive treatment discontinuation in a substantial proportion of patients, while the concomitant loss of lean muscle mass raises concerns about functional decline and long-term metabolic health, especially in elderly populations. Furthermore, cessation of therapy results in rapid weight regain through multi-faceted compensatory mechanisms involving central nervous system recalibration, hormonal adaptation, and metabolic reprogramming. To address these fundamental challenges and advance obesity therapeutics beyond monotherapy approaches, this report synthesizes current evidence regarding the mechanistic and clinical limitations of GLP-1R agonists, maps the compensatory physiological pathways that escape GLP-1 suppression, and proposes two novel antibody-based therapeutic targets that synergize with or complement GLP-1 signaling. The analysis integrates human genetics, preclinical mechanistic studies, and emerging clinical trial data to identify targets amenable to antibody-based modulation and to detail concrete therapeutic strategies that maximize efficacy while minimizing tolerability concerns and metabolic complications.

## Mechanistic and Clinical Limitations of GLP-1R Agonists: A Comprehensive Synthesis

### Clinical Adverse Events and Treatment Discontinuation

Gastrointestinal adverse events represent the most frequently reported and clinically consequential limitation of GLP-1R agonists across diverse patient populations. Clinical trial data demonstrate that nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and constipation occur in 40 to 85 percent of patients receiving GLP-1RA, with nausea being the most prevalent event, affecting 15 to 50 percent of patients during the dose-escalation phase[1]. These gastrointestinal symptoms typically manifest within the first four to five weeks of treatment, when gastric emptying is most significantly delayed, and generally resolve as patients reach maintenance dosing[1]. However, the temporal profile and magnitude of these events vary between individuals and across different GLP-1RA formulations, suggesting heterogeneity in the underlying mechanisms and potentially distinct adaptive processes in susceptible populations. Critically, while these adverse events are frequently characterized as mild to moderate in intensity, their real-world impact on treatment adherence and persistence is substantial, with studies indicating that a meaningful proportion of patients discontinue therapy specifically due to gastrointestinal intolerance[1]. This represents a critical treatment failure scenario in which the biological efficacy of the agent is negated by its tolerability profile, underscoring the clinical importance of understanding and mitigating these mechanisms.

The pathophysiology of GLP-1RA-induced gastrointestinal adverse events involves multiple interconnected mechanisms spanning the peripheral and central nervous systems. Nausea, being the most prevalent event, is mediated through activation of GLP-1 receptors expressed on vagal afferent neurons innervating the gastrointestinal tract and on neurons within the area postrema, a circumventricular organ lacking a complete blood-brain barrier and serving as a chemoreceptor trigger zone for emetic responses[7][39][42]. The area postrema contains functionally distinct neuronal populations that express GLP-1R, with specific subpopulations that project to the parabrachial nucleus being particularly implicated in nausea and aversive learning responses[39]. This circuit-based mechanistic understanding suggests that the nausea associated with GLP-1RA results not merely from passive gastric perturbations but rather from active engagement of centrally mediated emetic pathways, potentially explaining why some patients experience severe nausea despite modest reductions in food intake. The involvement of these discrete neural circuits also provides a mechanistic rationale for why nausea predominates over other gastrointestinal symptoms during the initial phase of GLP-1RA therapy, as the area postrema neurons and vagal sensory circuits may exhibit differential temporal dynamics of receptor engagement and desensitization compared to the more distributed GLP-1R expression in the enteric nervous system.

### Lean Mass Loss and Body Composition Concerns

While the magnitude of weight loss induced by GLP-1R agonists rivals that of bariatric surgery, the body composition profile of this weight loss raises mechanistic and clinical concerns distinct from weight reduction per se. Clinical trials and real-world observational studies demonstrate heterogeneity in lean mass preservation during GLP-1RA-induced weight loss, with some studies reporting that 40 to 60 percent of total weight lost is attributable to lean mass reduction, while other studies document lean mass losses of approximately 15 percent or less of total weight lost[2][5]. Semaglutide has been associated with lean mass loss of up to 40 percent of total weight loss, while liraglutide shows even higher proportions, with some estimates reaching 60 percent of total weight loss[5]. This substantial heterogeneity in lean mass preservation across trials and patient populations likely reflects differences in baseline physiology, age, disease severity, exercise engagement, and dietary protein intake, yet the underlying mechanistic drivers of lean mass loss during GLP-1RA therapy remain incompletely characterized. Current evidence suggests that lean mass changes during GLP-1RA therapy may reflect adaptive processes rather than pathological wasting, as improvements in insulin sensitivity and reductions in ectopic fat deposition within muscle tissue—reflected in decreased muscle fat infiltration—appear to enhance muscle quality despite modest reductions in volume[2][13]. Nevertheless, certain subpopulations, particularly older adults and those with pre-existing sarcopenia or frailty, represent potential vulnerability cohorts for whom even modest lean mass reductions could precipitate functional decline and increased cardiovascular and all-cause mortality risk.

The mechanistic basis of lean mass loss during GLP-1RA-induced weight loss involves at least three distinct biological processes. First, the caloric deficit imposed by reduced appetite and food intake represents the primary driver, as lean mass loss during any hypocaloric intervention is expected and proportional to the degree and duration of energy deficit achieved[2][8]. Second, alterations in circulating appetite-related hormones, including reductions in total peptide YY (PYY), cholecystokinin (CCK), and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) itself after weight loss, coupled with compensatory increases in acylated ghrelin, create a hormonal milieu that promotes lean mass catabolism relative to preferential fat mobilization[8]. Loss of fat-free mass appears to be a major driver of these hormonal changes, as fat-free mass loss preferentially increases circulating ghrelin concentrations and activates the preproghrelin gene, thereby promoting myocyte proliferation and adaptive lean mass loss[8]. Third, the loss of sympathetic nervous system signaling to brown adipose tissue and skeletal muscle during GLP-1RA therapy, coupled with reduced expression of thermogenic genes such as uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α), represents an adaptive response that reduces energy expenditure and thus drives preferential preservation of fat mass relative to metabolically active lean tissue[1][43]. This mechanistic understanding suggests that lean mass loss during GLP-1RA therapy is not an on-target toxicity but rather an adaptive metabolic response to energy deficit, yet this does not eliminate the clinical significance of the phenomenon in vulnerable populations.

### Weight Regain and Discontinuation-Dependent Reversal of Metabolic Benefits

A critical limitation of GLP-1RA monotherapy is the dependence of sustained weight loss and metabolic benefit on continuous drug administration. Discontinuation studies, particularly the STEP 1 trial extension and related real-world analyses, demonstrate that cessation of GLP-1RA results in rapid weight regain, with the majority of patients recovering most or all of the weight lost during the treatment period within a 12-month follow-up interval[3][6]. This weight regain occurs not merely through return to baseline caloric intake but through coordinated reactivation of compensatory physiological pathways that had been suppressed during GLP-1RA therapy. The mechanistic drivers of weight regain involve at least three distinct biological processes: temporary hormonal adjustment in response to weight reduction, central nervous system (CNS) incompetence in regulating weight gain due to lack of GLP-1RA engagement, and pancreatic β-cell dysfunction due to prolonged suppression of endogenous GLP-1 secretion during GLP-1RA therapy[3]. Cardiometabolic variables that improved during GLP-1RA therapy, including blood pressure, lipid profiles, and glycemic control, frequently return to near-baseline levels following treatment discontinuation, suggesting that the metabolic benefits are intimately dependent on continuous GLP-1R engagement rather than reflecting durable physiological remodeling[3][6].

The neural circuitry governing this weight regain involves reactivation of appetite-promoting agouti-related peptide (AgRP) and neuropeptide Y (NPY) neurons in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus that had been suppressed during GLP-1RA therapy through direct GLP-1R activation of these neurons and indirect modulation through upstream adiposity signals[9][12][27]. Upon cessation of GLP-1RA, the restoration of endogenous neural GLP-1 production, which derives primarily from neurons in the nucleus of the solitary tract and extends throughout the hypothalamus and brainstem[7], may be insufficient to maintain the appetite suppression achieved during pharmacological dosing, thereby permitting reactivation of AgRP and NPY neuronal activity. Simultaneously, reductions in circulating leptin that accompany weight loss activate these same orexigenic neurons and suppress proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neuron activity, creating a synchronized hormonal and neural signal that promotes food-seeking behavior and reduces energy expenditure[11][30]. This coordinated reactivation of appetite pathways likely evolved as a homeostatic mechanism to restore body weight to a genetically determined set point, yet in the context of obesity therapeutics it represents a major limitation to sustained weight loss without continuous pharmacological intervention. Future research focusing on whether extended GLP-1RA therapy beyond two years might durably reprogram these neural circuits or whether gene therapy approaches could provide sustained endogenous GLP-1 expression remains a critical area for investigation.

## Compensatory Physiological and Metabolic Pathways: Mapping the Escape Routes from GLP-1 Suppression

### The AgRP-POMC Neuronal Balance and Appetite Counter-Regulation

While GLP-1R agonists effectively suppress food intake through direct activation of POMC neurons and indirect inhibition of AgRP neurons in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus, the compensatory reactivation of AgRP signaling upon treatment cessation, combined with the persistent activity of these neurons even during ongoing GLP-1RA therapy in certain metabolic states, suggests that this neuronal balance represents a critical compensatory node inadequately suppressed by GLP-1 monotherapy. Recent mechanistic studies demonstrate that GLP-1RA-induced activation of POMC neurons and inhibition of AgRP neurons is temporally dependent on metabolic state, with greater POMC activation and AgRP inhibition occurring in the fed state compared to the fasted state, suggesting state-dependent engagement of these circuits[12]. Furthermore, optogenetic stimulation of AgRP neurons partially attenuates the appetite-suppressing effects of GLP-1R agonism, indicating that inhibition of AgRP neurons may be necessary for the full appetite-suppressing effects of incretin-based therapeutics[27]. This mechanistic insight suggests that strategies that more potently or reliably suppress AgRP neuronal activity—independent of metabolic state—could enhance the efficacy of GLP-1RA and potentially reduce heterogeneity in clinical response. However, complete and durable AgRP suppression also carries potential risks of hypophagia and metabolic suppression, requiring careful titration and monitoring.

The reciprocal activity of AgRP and POMC neurons is governed by a downstream integrative neurocircuit involving neuropeptide Y receptor 1 (Npy1R)-expressing neurons in the paraventricular hypothalamus, which receive converging input from both AgRP and POMC neuronal populations[9]. These Npy1R neurons act as a relay station integrating signals from both appetite-promoting and appetite-suppressing pathways and project to downstream effector regions including the nucleus of the solitary tract, thereby coordinating the final output of the central feeding circuit. This architecture suggests that modulation of Npy1R signaling could represent an alternative point of intervention for enhancing appetite suppression independent of direct POMC-AgRP targeting, though the pleiotropic functions of NPY in stress responses, energy expenditure regulation, and other behavioral processes necessitate careful evaluation of potential off-target effects.

### Gut-Brain Signaling and Vagal Afferent Pathways: Incomplete Blockade of Peripheral Appetite Signals

While GLP-1R agonists suppress food intake through both central mechanisms (direct POMC/AgRP modulation) and peripheral mechanisms (gastric emptying delay, direct vagal afferent modulation), the incomplete suppression of other peripheral appetite signals through vagal and endocrine routes represents an important compensatory pathway. Cholecystokinin (CCK), released from enteroendocrine I-cells in the upper intestine in response to nutrient ingestion, acts through CCK-1 receptors on vagal afferents to promote satiation through a mechanism distinct from GLP-1 signaling[45][48]. The additive or synergistic interaction between GLP-1 and CCK in suppressing food intake suggests that the vagal afferent compartment represents a critical site of integration for multiple appetite-suppressing signals, and that enhancement of CCK signaling during GLP-1RA therapy could amplify appetite suppression without proportionally increasing GLP-1R-mediated adverse effects. Peptide YY, another enteroendocrine hormone released from L-cells throughout the small intestine and colon, similarly acts through Y2 receptors on vagal afferents to promote satiation, and meta-analytic evidence demonstrates that dietary weight loss is accompanied by reductions in circulating PYY concentrations that correlate with weight regain risk, suggesting that augmentation of PYY signaling could enhance the durability of GLP-1RA-induced weight loss[8]. Importantly, the incomplete suppression of these peripheral appetite signals by GLP-1 monotherapy likely reflects the selectivity of GLP-1R agonism for GLP-1R-expressing tissues, necessitating either higher doses of GLP-1RA (which carry increased adverse event risk) or parallel modulation of complementary satiation pathways.

Bile acid signaling, traditionally understood as a mechanism for lipid absorption and enterohepatic circulation, has emerged as a critical regulator of energy metabolism and appetite through activation of farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5 (TGR5) expressed on enteroendocrine L-cells, vagal afferents, and multiple other nutrient-sensing tissues[18]. Postprandial bile acid signaling through FXR and TGR5 promotes GLP-1 secretion from L-cells and modulates nutrient sensing through vagal pathways, and dysregulation of bile acid metabolism in obesity may contribute to reduced GLP-1 responsiveness and compensatory appetitive responses. While GLP-1RA does not directly modulate bile acid signaling, the loss of weight-induced changes in bile acid metabolism upon GLP-1RA discontinuation may contribute to compensatory increases in food intake and metabolic recalibration. Fibroblast growth factor 15/19 (FGF15/19) similarly represents an important but GLP-1-independent nutrient-sensing pathway that regulates feeding behavior, energy expenditure, and hepatic lipid metabolism[15][26][29]. Pharmacological administration of FGF21, a fasting-induced hormone with profound effects on glucose and lipid homeostasis, induces sustained weight loss and improved insulin sensitivity in obese animal models, yet circulating FGF21 is elevated in obesity, suggesting a compensatory but insufficient endogenous response[29]. The incomplete engagement of these alternative nutrient-sensing and appetite-regulating pathways by GLP-1 monotherapy may represent a source of residual appetite drive and metabolic adaptation that could be targeted through complementary therapeutic approaches.

### Myostatin and Activin A: Suppressors of Lean Mass During Energy Restriction

The transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) superfamily member myostatin (growth differentiation factor 8, GDF8) and the related ligand activin A (INHBA) represent key negative regulators of skeletal muscle mass through signaling via activin type II receptors (ActRIIA/B)[28][56][59]. Myostatin, secreted by muscle fibers, circulates systemically and acts through ActRIIA/B signaling in autocrine and endocrine fashion to suppress myogenesis and promote myostatin-linked muscle fiber atrophy. During energy restriction and weight loss—the state achieved during GLP-1RA therapy—myostatin signaling is activated as part of an adaptive response that preferentially directs substrate utilization toward fat mobilization rather than lean tissue maintenance[28]. This adaptive activation of myostatin during hypocaloric states represents a genetically conserved mechanism for optimizing survival during periods of energy scarcity by reducing the metabolic burden of maintaining muscle tissue. However, in the context of obesity pharmacotherapy, this adaptive myostatin activation becomes maladaptive, driving preferential lean mass loss that exceeds what would be expected from the degree of caloric restriction alone and precipitating functional decline. Critically, GLP-1R agonists do not modulate myostatin or activin A signaling, leaving this compensatory lean mass-suppressing pathway fully active during GLP-1RA therapy. Blockade of myostatin and activin A through antibody-mediated antagonism of their ActRIIA/B receptors has been demonstrated to preserve or even increase lean mass during weight loss induced by GLP-1RA, representing one of the most promising therapeutic combinations for improving body composition outcomes.

The mechanistic basis of myostatin and activin A-mediated lean mass loss during GLP-1RA therapy involves modulation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-protein kinase B (AKT) signaling and other anabolic pathways in muscle that promote protein synthesis and suppress protein degradation[56][59]. During energy restriction, reduced insulin and increased glucagon signaling (both partially reversed by GLP-1RA but not completely normalized) create a catabolic milieu in which myostatin-SMAD2/3 signaling antagonizes the anabolic effects of residual insulin signaling, thereby tipping the balance toward net lean mass loss. Blockade of myostatin and activin A relieves this antagonism, permitting the anabolic effects of residual insulin and other growth-promoting signals to predominate, thereby preserving muscle mass even in the face of caloric restriction. Recent preclinical data demonstrate that dual blockade of myostatin and activin A during GLP-1RA therapy in both obese mice and non-human primates results in preserved or increased lean mass concurrent with enhanced fat mass loss, suggesting that this combination achieves superior body composition outcomes compared to GLP-1RA monotherapy[59].

### Area Postrema GDF15 Circuit: Central Integration of Aversive Feeding Signals

Growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15), a distant member of the TGF-β superfamily, acts as a circulating hormone with profound suppressive effects on food intake and appetite through activation of GDF15 receptor GFRAL (GDF15 receptor family member L) expressed exclusively in the area postrema[50][53]. The GDF15-GFRAL-RET signaling axis represents an important complementary pathway to GLP-1R signaling that mediates nausea, vomiting, taste aversion, and anorexia in response to cellular stress, chemotherapy, and other adverse stimuli[50][53]. Notably, this pathway exhibits desensitization upon chronic exposure to GDF15, such that prior elevation of circulating GDF15 levels—as occurs in pregnancy, some metabolic diseases, and chronic illness—reduces the acute anorectic and emetic response to subsequent GDF15 exposure[53]. This desensitization mechanism suggests that the GDF15-GFRAL pathway represents a "use-dependent" appetite suppression mechanism that may contribute to the adaptation of nausea during the initial phase of GLP-1RA therapy. While GDF15 is not directly modulated by GLP-1RA, the incomplete suppression of this alternative aversive feeding pathway during GLP-1RA therapy may represent a compensatory mechanism that limits the absolute magnitude of appetite suppression achievable through GLP-1 signaling alone. Furthermore, the activation of area postrema GDF15 circuitry during GLP-1RA therapy may directly contribute to the nausea and vomiting side effects through overlapping neural circuits, suggesting that modulation of this pathway could simultaneously enhance appetite suppression and reduce adverse effects—a potentially synergistic therapeutic target.

### Hepatic Lipid Metabolism and Insulin Sensitivity: Incomplete Metabolic Reprogramming

While GLP-1RA induces improvements in hepatic steatosis, hepatic insulin sensitivity, and glucose production through multiple mechanisms including direct GLP-1R signaling in hepatocytes and indirect effects through weight loss and improved adipose tissue function, the incomplete normalization of hepatic lipid metabolism and the persistence of dyslipidemia in some patients suggests that complementary targeting of hepatic metabolic pathways could enhance the metabolic benefits of GLP-1RA monotherapy. Fibroblast growth factors, particularly FGF21 and FGF15/19, represent master regulators of hepatic lipid and glucose metabolism that are not directly engaged by GLP-1R signaling[15][26][29]. FGF21, upregulated during fasting and periods of metabolic stress through fatty acid-activated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) signaling in hepatocytes, enhances insulin sensitivity, promotes hepatic fatty acid oxidation, and suppresses hepatic gluconeogenesis through mechanisms that appear synergistic with but distinct from GLP-1R signaling[29]. The incomplete upregulation of FGF21 during GLP-1RA therapy, relative to what occurs during fasting or other metabolic stress states, may represent a compensatory adaptation that limits the improvement in hepatic lipid metabolism and insulin sensitivity achievable through GLP-1 signaling alone. Furthermore, emerging evidence demonstrates that GLP-1RA-induced weight loss is associated with improved muscle quality and reduced ectopic fat deposition within muscle, mediated in part through enhanced insulin sensitivity and reduced lipotoxicity[2], yet complementary modulation of hepatic lipid partitioning could further enhance these benefits and reduce the residual cardiometabolic risk in patients with obesity and associated comorbidities.

### Adipose Tissue Inflammation and Dysfunction: Persistent TNFα and IL-6 Signaling

While GLP-1RA therapy induces weight loss and improvements in insulin sensitivity through multiple mechanisms including reduced adipose tissue inflammation, persistent low-grade chronic inflammation in adipose tissue—driven by infiltration of pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages and elevated expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) and interleukin-6 (IL-6)—may limit the maximal metabolic benefit achievable through weight loss alone[37][40]. Obesity-associated adipose tissue inflammation involves recruitment of innate and adaptive immune cells that produce pro-inflammatory cytokines, particularly TNFα and IL-6, which impair insulin signaling in adipocytes and systemic tissues, thereby contributing to insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction[37][40]. While weight loss induced by GLP-1RA reduces adipose tissue inflammation, this improvement is proportional to the magnitude of weight loss and is ultimately dependent on continuous GLP-1RA administration, suggesting that direct anti-inflammatory targeting could provide complementary benefits. IL-6 signaling represents a particularly complex compensatory node, as this cytokine exerts both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory effects depending on the source (adipocyte vs myeloid cell) and the mode of signaling (classical vs trans-signaling)[40]. Blockade of IL-6 signaling through receptor antagonism has been shown to increase body weight and BMI in patients receiving IL-6 pathway inhibitors (tocilizumab, sarilumab) for autoimmune diseases, suggesting that complete IL-6 suppression may be maladaptive[49]. However, selective modulation of adipocyte-derived IL-6 or of the pro-inflammatory M1 macrophage pool in adipose tissue might enhance the metabolic benefits of GLP-1RA without the systemic metabolic suppression associated with global IL-6 blockade.

## Next-Generation Antibody Targets: Dossier and Therapeutic Strategies

### Target 1: Myostatin (GDF8) and Activin A (INHBA) Dual Blockade via ActRII Receptor Antagonism

**Biological Rationale and Mechanistic Positioning**

Myostatin and activin A represent functionally distinct yet mechanistically overlapping ligands that signal through the same activin type II receptor complex (ActRIIA/B-ALK4/5) to suppress skeletal muscle growth and promote myocyte atrophy through SMAD2/3-dependent transcriptional reprogramming[28][56][59]. Myostatin, a skeletal muscle-derived hormone, circulates systemically and acts in autocrine and endocrine fashion to suppress myogenic differentiation and promote protein catabolism in muscle. Activin A, produced by multiple tissues including immune cells, adipose tissue, and bone, similarly signals through ActRIIA/B to suppress muscle growth and promote inflammatory responses and metabolic dysfunction[59]. During energy restriction and weight loss—the physiological state achieved during GLP-1RA therapy—both myostatin and activin A signaling are activated as part of an adaptive catabolic program that favors mobilization of stored energy while minimizing the metabolic expense of lean tissue maintenance. This adaptive activation of myostatin-activin A signaling during caloric restriction represents an evolutionary conserved mechanism for optimizing survival during periods of energy scarcity, yet in the context of obesity pharmacotherapy, this adaptive response becomes pathological by driving accelerated lean mass loss that exceeds the expected degree based on caloric deficit alone and contributes to functional decline and increased mortality risk, particularly in elderly populations.

Critically, GLP-1R agonists engage the appetite-suppressing and metabolic benefit pathways through mechanisms entirely independent of ActRII signaling, leaving the myostatin-activin A-mediated lean mass loss pathway fully active and unopposed during GLP-1RA monotherapy. This mechanistic independence means that blockade of ActRII signaling provides orthogonal benefits that do not compete with or antagonize GLP-1R-mediated improvements in glycemic control or cardiometabolic endpoints. Preclinical evidence demonstrates that dual blockade of myostatin and activin A through antibody-mediated antagonism of their ActRII receptors during GLP-1RA therapy in diet-induced obese mice results in preserved or increased lean mass concurrent with enhanced fat mass loss, suggesting that this combination achieves superior body composition outcomes[59]. In non-human primates, semaglutide-based combination therapy with trevogrumab (myostatin antibody) and garetosmab (activin A antibody) doubled fat mass loss (50% vs 25%) and increased lean mass by 11.7% relative to semaglutide treatment alone over 20 weeks[25].

**Proposed Antibody Modality and Therapeutic Strategy**

The therapeutic strategy for ActRII antagonism to preserve lean mass during GLP-1RA therapy involves monoclonal antibodies that specifically block myostatin and activin A through ActRIIA/B inhibition. Two approaches are currently under clinical development: (1) blockade of the shared ActRIIA/B receptor using a single broadly neutralizing antibody, or (2) dual blockade using separate monoclonal antibodies targeting myostatin and activin A respectively with complementary binding epitopes[56][59]. The dual antibody approach offers mechanistic specificity by targeting the individual ligands rather than the shared receptor, potentially reducing off-target effects on other TGF-β superfamily members that signal through related receptors. Bimagrumab, a monoclonal antibody antagonist of activin type II receptors, has demonstrated clinical efficacy in increasing skeletal muscle mass in humans with obesity and type 2 diabetes while decreasing fat mass[25]. Trevogrumab (REGN1033) and garetosmab (REGN2477) represent fully human recombinant monoclonal antibodies that specifically bind and inhibit myostatin and activin A respectively, thereby providing dual blockade with enhanced specificity[59].

The proposed therapeutic regimen consists of fixed-dose combination or sequential co-administration of GLP-1RA (e.g., semaglutide) with myostatin-specific antibody (trevogrumab or equivalent) and activin A-specific antibody (garetosmab or equivalent). The antibodies, being IgG4-based molecules, exhibit extended serum half-lives (approximately 3 weeks for IgG4 antibodies) permitting once-weekly or once-biweekly dosing schedules that align with GLP-1RA administration schedules. The combination strategy leverages the distinct mechanisms of action of each therapeutic: GLP-1RA suppresses appetite and reduces caloric intake while improving glycemic control, while ActRII antagonism preserves anabolic muscle signaling and prevents the compensatory myostatin-activin A-mediated lean mass loss that would otherwise occur in response to the energy deficit. Co-administration of these agents could be achieved through either simultaneous injection of separate formulations or through development of a bispecific antibody containing both anti-myostatin and anti-activin A binding domains, though the latter would require resolution of manufacturing and Fc-mediated effector function challenges.

**Expected Improvements Over GLP-1RA Monotherapy**

Relative to GLP-1RA monotherapy, the combination of GLP-1RA with dual myostatin-activin A blockade is anticipated to yield the following clinical benefits: (1) preservation of skeletal muscle mass despite weight loss, with proportions of weight loss attributable to fat mass potentially reaching 90-95% compared to typical GLP-1RA monotherapy values of 75-85%[13][16][56]; (2) enhanced exercise capacity and functional performance through maintenance of muscle mass and improved muscle quality (reduced ectopic fat infiltration); (3) reduced risk of sarcopenia and functional decline in elderly and frail populations; (4) improved long-term metabolic sustainability through preservation of resting energy expenditure, which depends primarily on fat-free mass; and (5) enhanced cardiometabolic outcomes through complementary pathways, as myostatin and activin A blockade improves insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis through AMPK activation and enhanced glucose uptake in muscle independent of weight loss[56]. The magnitude of these improvements in real-world clinical practice remains to be determined through Phase 2b and Phase 3 clinical trials, but preclinical data suggest that dual blockade could reduce the proportion of lean mass loss from typical values of 25-40% of total weight loss to <10-15% of total weight loss.

**Risk Mitigation and Safety Considerations**

While antibody-mediated blockade of myostatin and activin A represents a promising approach for preserving lean mass during GLP-1RA therapy, several potential safety concerns and mechanistic risks require careful evaluation and monitoring strategies. First, myostatin and activin A signal through the same ActRIIA/B receptor complex shared by other TGF-β superfamily ligands, including activins B and C and other bone morphogenetic proteins, which carry distinct biological functions in immune regulation, bone metabolism, and other tissues[28][56]. Off-target effects on these alternative ligands could precipitate unintended metabolic or immune consequences. However, the use of ligand-specific antibodies (anti-myostatin, anti-activin A) rather than receptor-level blockade allows greater specificity and reduces the risk of off-target TGF-β superfamily effects. Second, complete and sustained blockade of myostatin and activin A signaling in the context of obesity therapy could theoretically result in excessive muscle hypertrophy or maladaptive metabolic remodeling. However, preclinical data demonstrate that combination ActRIIA antagonism with GLP-1RA results in preservation of lean mass at levels commensurate with expected aging and disease-related losses rather than supraphysiologic hypertrophy, suggesting that the combination achieves balanced lean mass maintenance rather than excessive muscle growth[59].

Third, myostatin and activin A exert pleiotropic functions beyond muscle mass regulation, including roles in immune function, bone metabolism, and cardiovascular physiology[28]. Blockade of these pathways could theoretically impair immune competence and increase infection risk, accelerate bone loss and increase fracture risk, or alter cardiovascular function. However, clinical trials of myostatin-targeting antibodies in muscular dystrophy and sarcopenia have not revealed clinically significant increases in infection rates or immune dysfunction, suggesting that myostatin targeting is not associated with immunosuppression. Bone metabolism effects require careful monitoring through longitudinal assessment of bone mineral density and bone turnover markers, with potential co-administration of bisphosphonates or other bone-protective agents if indicated. Cardiovascular effects are being actively monitored in ongoing clinical trials of ActRII-targeting antibodies, with particular attention to blood pressure, heart rate, and cardiac function given the expression of activin receptors in cardiac tissue.

Fourth, the blockade of activin A, beyond its role in muscle regulation, modulates immune responses and inflammatory pathways, raising the theoretical concern that anti-activin A antibodies could dampen beneficial anti-inflammatory effects of weight loss or impair immune responses to infection or malignancy. This risk appears minimal based on current clinical experience with activin-targeting therapeutics, yet ongoing pharmacovigilance for atypical infections or malignancy patterns remains prudent. Finally, the combination of GLP-1RA with ActRII antagonism could theoretically result in excessive weight loss or metabolic suppression if the simultaneous appetite suppression and lean mass preservation resulted in unanticipated losses of fat mass. However, preclinical data suggest that dual blockade results in enhanced fat mass loss without hypophagia or excessive metabolic suppression, likely because the appetite-suppressing effects of GLP-1RA remain unchanged while the preservation of lean mass optimizes metabolic efficiency. Recommended monitoring strategies include baseline and periodic assessments of skeletal muscle mass and quality through dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), muscle strength testing through validated functional assessments, bone mineral density and bone turnover markers, immune function parameters, and cardiovascular biomarkers including blood pressure, heart rate, echocardiography, and troponin or natriuretic peptide levels in high-risk populations.

### Target 2: GDF15-GFRAL Circuit Modulation via Selective Area Postrema GDF15 Desensitization Prevention or GFRAL Partial Agonism

**Biological Rationale and Mechanistic Positioning**

Growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15), a circulating hormone produced in response to cellular stress, acts through its brainstem-restricted receptor GFRAL (a heterodimer complex with RET tyrosine kinase) expressed exclusively in the area postrema to mediate nausea, vomiting, taste aversion, anorexia, and reduced food intake[50][53]. The GDF15-GFRAL-RET signaling axis represents an important complementary pathway to GLP-1R signaling that operates through distinct neural circuits and molecular mechanisms, yet converges with GLP-1 signaling in the area postrema and other brainstem regions. Critically, the GDF15-GFRAL pathway exhibits pronounced desensitization upon chronic or repeated exposure to elevated circulating GDF15 levels[53]. This desensitization mechanism, demonstrated through experiments in which mice chronically exposed to elevated GDF15 show markedly attenuated food intake and body weight responses to acute GDF15 boluses compared to GDF15-naive mice, suggests that prior elevation of circulating GDF15—as occurs in pregnancy, metabolic disease, chemotherapy exposure, and chronic illness—reduces the acute anorectic and emetic response to subsequent GDF15 elevation[53]. The mechanistic basis of this desensitization likely involves receptor downregulation, uncoupling of downstream signaling cascades, or activity-dependent modulation of area postrema neural circuits, though the precise molecular mechanisms remain incompletely characterized.

The GDF15-GFRAL desensitization mechanism provides a mechanistic explanation for the temporal dynamics of nausea during the initial phase of GLP-1RA therapy. GLP-1 signaling in the area postrema activates GDF15-responsive neurons through area postrema GDF15R neurons that project to the parabrachial nucleus and other brainstem emetic centers[39]. However, during the dose-escalation phase of GLP-1RA therapy, the progressive increase in circulating GDF15 in response to GLP-1-induced cellular stress and weight loss may trigger compensatory desensitization of the GDF15-GFRAL axis, thereby reducing the nausea signal even as GLP-1R signaling intensity remains elevated. This desensitization of the GDF15-GFRAL pathway likely contributes to the observation that nausea during GLP-1RA therapy typically peaks during the first 4-5 weeks of treatment and then partially resolves despite continued GLP-1RA escalation[1]. Critically, the incomplete resolution of nausea in some patients despite presumed GDF15-GFRAL desensitization suggests that GLP-1-mediated nausea is polymodal—involving both direct area postrema GLP-1R activation and indirect effects through GDF15 and other stress-response hormones—and that alternative nausea pathways remain active even as the GDF15-GFRAL circuit desensitizes.

**Proposed Antibody Modality and Therapeutic Strategy**

The therapeutic strategy to reduce nausea during GLP-1RA therapy through GDF15-GFRAL circuit modulation could employ either of two complementary approaches: (1) prevention of endogenous GDF15-mediated nausea through GDF15 neutralization via monoclonal antibody ligand trapping, or (2) selective enhancement of GDF15-GFRAL desensitization prevention to maintain the anorexic benefits of the GDF15 pathway while minimizing the emetic component. The first approach involves development of monoclonal antibodies that selectively neutralize or trap circulating GDF15, thereby preventing ligand-mediated activation of GFRAL-expressing neurons in the area postrema and reducing GDF15-dependent nausea while maintaining GLP-1R-dependent appetite suppression[50][53]. This strategy would employ IgG-based monoclonal antibodies with high-affinity binding to circulating human GDF15, achieving selective ligand trapping without cross-reactivity with other TGF-β superfamily members or disruption of GFRAL-independent GDF15 signaling (though GFRAL is currently the only characterized GDF15 receptor in the brain, other uncharacterized GDF15 binding partners may exist peripherally). The antibody would have a prolonged serum half-life through standard IgG Fc engineering, permitting once-weekly or once-biweekly dosing aligned with GLP-1RA administration schedules.

The second approach involves development of partial agonist antibodies or engineered ligands that activate GFRAL with reduced efficacy relative to native GDF15, thereby maintaining appetite suppression while reducing the magnitude of emetic signaling[50][53]. This approach would require crystal structure-informed antibody design or protein engineering to achieve selective partial GFRAL agonism while avoiding immunogenicity risks inherent in non-IgG scaffolds. Alternatively, selective area postrema GDF15R antagonism through region-specific brain targeting could theoretically enhance desensitization by preventing the development of compensatory plasticity that maintains anorectic sensitivity despite chronic GFRAL engagement. However, this approach would require either blood-brain barrier penetration strategies (unlikely for standard IgG antibodies) or local intracerebral delivery, which is not clinically practical for chronic therapy.

The proposed therapeutic regimen consists of co-administration of GLP-1RA (e.g., semaglutide) with a GDF15-neutralizing monoclonal antibody or GFRAL partial agonist. The GDF15-targeting antibody would be administered concurrently with GLP-1RA initiation and throughout the dose-escalation phase, with potential tapering or discontinuation as endogenous GDF15-GFRAL desensitization develops (typically by weeks 8-12 of GLP-1RA therapy). Alternatively, the GDF15-neutralizing antibody could be administered selectively during the highest-risk periods for GDF15-mediated nausea (e.g., weeks 1-8 of GLP-1RA therapy), with discontinuation once desensitization has developed, thereby minimizing unnecessary antibody exposure in the maintenance phase.

**Expected Improvements Over GLP-1RA Monotherapy**

Relative to GLP-1RA monotherapy, the addition of GDF15-neutralizing antibody or GFRAL partial agonist is anticipated to reduce nausea severity and duration, thereby improving treatment tolerability and persistence in the critical initial phase of therapy. Expected specific improvements include: (1) reduction in nausea incidence and severity during the dose-escalation phase of GLP-1RA therapy, potentially reducing the proportion of patients discontinuing therapy due to gastrointestinal intolerance; (2) sustained appetite suppression through maintained GLP-1R signaling while reducing GDF15-mediated emetic signaling, thereby uncoupling the appetite-suppressing benefits of GDF15 pathway engagement from its maladaptive emetic side effects; (3) improved patient adherence and quality of life during the critical initial treatment phase, thereby enhancing real-world efficacy and clinical outcomes; and (4) potential dose escalation acceleration, allowing patients to reach higher therapeutic GLP-1RA doses with reduced nausea burden, though this could paradoxically reduce the selective advantage if nausea reduction permits excessive rapid dose escalation and precipitates GLP-1R-mediated adverse effects (see risk discussion below). The magnitude of nausea reduction achievable through GDF15 neutralization remains to be determined through clinical trials, but preliminary mechanistic evidence suggests that 30-50% reduction in nausea-related symptom burden might be achievable through selective GDF15-GFRAL pathway modulation without loss of appetite-suppressing efficacy.

**Risk Mitigation and Safety Considerations**

While selective GDF15 neutralization represents a promising approach for reducing nausea during GLP-1RA therapy, several mechanistic and clinical risks require careful evaluation and mitigation strategies. First, GDF15, beyond its role in nausea and appetite suppression, exerts important metabolic regulatory functions including modulation of energy expenditure, hepatic glucose production, and immune responses to cellular stress[50]. Chronic blockade of GDF15 signaling through antibody neutralization could theoretically impair these adaptive stress responses, leading to reduced metabolic flexibility or impaired immune responses to infection or metabolic stress. However, the area postrema appears to be the predominant site of GDF15 action relevant to feeding behavior, while GDF15 actions in other tissues may be partially preserved through autocrine or paracrine signaling that is not blocked by circulating GDF15-neutralizing antibodies. Recommended monitoring should include assessment of metabolic flexibility through indirect calorimetry or other functional measures, as well as surveillance for atypical infections or failure to mount appropriate metabolic stress responses.

Second, GDF15 signaling through GFRAL in the area postrema contributes to defensive behaviors against potentially toxic foods or substances, with nausea and taste aversion serving as protective mechanisms that prevent consumption of harmful substances[50][53]. Chronic GDF15 neutralization could theoretically reduce these protective aversive responses, thereby impairing the ability to detect and avoid harmful substances. However, this risk appears minimal in the obesity treatment context, as the nausea and aversion responses mediated by GDF15 are typically triggered by endogenous signals of cellular stress rather than exogenous toxins. Moreover, the partial or time-limited nature of the GDF15 neutralization approach (discontinuation once desensitization develops) further minimizes this risk.

Third, enhanced appetite suppression through prevention of GDF15-GFRAL desensitization could paradoxically increase the risk of excessive weight loss or development of anorexic symptomatology if the combined effects of GLP-1RA and enhanced GDF15 signaling result in pathologically suppressed food intake[50]. This risk could be mitigated through careful patient selection (exclusion of patients with history of eating disorders or psychiatric illness predisposing to anorexia) and monitoring for development of pathologically low food intake, weight loss exceeding target goals, or psychiatric symptoms during therapy. Additionally, the temporal limitation of GDF15 neutralization to the critical initial phase of GLP-1RA therapy (rather than chronic administration) reduces the risk of long-term excessive weight loss or anorexia.

Fourth, the use of GDF15-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies introduces risks of immunogenicity, particularly if the antibodies are non-human or partially humanized. However, the development of fully humanized or human-derived GDF15-neutralizing antibodies (through phage display or other antibody engineering approaches) minimizes immunogenicity risk. Recommended safety monitoring includes baseline and periodic assessments of anti-drug antibodies, immune function parameters, and adverse event surveillance for signs of hypersensitivity or immune-related complications.

Finally, there is theoretical risk that GDF15 neutralization during the acute phase of GLP-1RA therapy, by reducing nausea and permitting faster dose escalation, could lead to excessive rapid dose escalation and precipitate GLP-1R-mediated adverse effects in other organ systems (e.g., gastroparesis, pancreatitis, thyroid effects) that might have been self-limited through nausea-induced dose limiting. This risk could be mitigated through standardized dose-escalation protocols that proceed at fixed intervals regardless of nausea burden, rather than patient-driven or symptom-driven acceleration. Additionally, careful monitoring for other GLP-1R-mediated adverse effects during combination therapy remains essential.

## Integrated Therapeutic Strategy and Clinical Development Pathway

The combination of GLP-1RA with dual myostatin-activin A blockade for lean mass preservation and selective GDF15-GFRAL modulation for nausea reduction represents an integrated therapeutic strategy that addresses the major mechanistic and clinical limitations of GLP-1RA monotherapy through complementary and orthogonal mechanisms. The proposed clinical development pathway would consist of the following phases: Phase 1 evaluation of safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of the combination regimen in healthy volunteers and patients with obesity; Phase 2a proof-of-concept studies demonstrating the efficacy of each component in isolation and in combination on body composition, nausea reduction, and metabolic endpoints in small patient cohorts; Phase 2b randomized controlled trials comparing GLP-1RA monotherapy versus GLP-1RA + ActRII antagonists versus GLP-1RA + GDF15-neutralizing antibody versus triple combination therapy in diverse patient populations; and Phase 3 pivotal efficacy and safety trials in large, representative patient cohorts with longer-term follow-up to assess durability, safety, and real-world effectiveness of the combination regimen.

The clinical development strategy should prioritize populations where the specific limitations of GLP-1RA monotherapy are most pronounced or clinically consequential. For ActRII antagonism, priority populations would include elderly patients (age >65) in whom lean mass loss poses substantial risk of functional decline and increased mortality, patients with pre-existing sarcopenia or frailty, and patients in whom preservation of exercise capacity and physical function is a key treatment goal. For GDF15-GFRAL modulation, priority populations would include patients with severe GDF15-mediated nausea that threatens treatment persistence, patients with psychiatric illness or eating disorder history in whom enhanced appetite suppression poses risk of anorexic symptomatology, and patients in whom early GLP-1RA discontinuation due to intolerance was previously documented in failed treatment attempts. Real-world effectiveness studies in diverse healthcare settings will be essential to demonstrate that the mechanistic benefits observed in clinical trials translate to improved treatment persistence, body composition outcomes, and long-term cardiometabolic benefits in routine clinical practice.

## Conclusion

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists have revolutionized obesity therapy and metabolic disease management, yet their clinical utility remains constrained by gastrointestinal adverse events, loss of lean muscle mass, and dependence on continuous pharmacological administration for sustained weight loss. Through mechanistic analysis of the neural circuits, hormonal pathways, and compensatory physiological responses that escape GLP-1 suppression, we have identified two complementary antibody-based therapeutic targets that synergize with or complement GLP-1 signaling to address these fundamental limitations. Dual blockade of myostatin and activin A through ActRII receptor antagonism preserves skeletal muscle mass during weight loss, thereby improving body composition outcomes and reducing sarcopenia risk in vulnerable populations. Selective GDF15-GFRAL modulation through ligand neutralization or partial agonism reduces nausea burden during the critical initial phase of GLP-1RA therapy, thereby enhancing treatment tolerability and persistence. Together, these next-generation antibody-based approaches represent a paradigm shift in obesity therapeutics from monotherapy targeting to mechanistically informed combination strategies that optimize efficacy, tolerability, and metabolic health across diverse patient populations. Future clinical development of these combination regimens will require rigorous evaluation of safety, efficacy, cost-effectiveness, and real-world implementation feasibility to determine whether the mechanistic promise of improved body composition and reduced adverse effects translates into clinically meaningful benefits and improved long-term outcomes in obesity care.
