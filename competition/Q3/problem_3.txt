Problem 3. [Identification of Next-Generation Antibody Targets to Overcome the Limitations of GLP-1R Agonists in Obesity Treatment]


Background
GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists have revolutionized the treatment of obesity, demonstrating unprecedented efficacy in body weight reduction. However, their clinical use is associated with significant limitations, including gastrointestinal adverse effects, nausea and vomiting, and loss of lean muscle mass. Moreover, GLP-1–based therapies do not fully address the complex compensatory physiological and metabolic pathways that counteract sustained weight loss.
Next-generation obesity therapeutics aim to go beyond simple weight reduction and instead focus on improving overall metabolic health while minimizing adverse effects. Achieving this goal requires a deeper understanding of the mechanistic limitations of GLP-1 signaling and the identification of novel therapeutic targets that can synergize with or complement GLP-1–based interventions.

Task
Analyze the mechanistic and clinical limitations of GLP-1R agonists and propose next-generation antibody-based therapeutic targets that could overcome these limitations.
1) Analysis of Limitations and Compensatory Pathways of GLP-1–Based Obesity Therapies
•	Identify the major clinical and mechanistic limitations of GLP-1R agonists
•	Analyze compensatory physiological and metabolic pathways linked to GLP-1 signaling
•	Propose key compensatory nodes that are:
o	Functionally relevant to obesity and metabolic regulation
o	Not sufficiently suppressed or modulated by GLP-1 alone
2) Proposal of Next-Generation Antibody Targets and Therapeutic Strategies
Based on your analysis:
•	Propose two novel therapeutic targets that could:
o	Act in mechanistic synergy with GLP-1
o	Or complement GLP-1 signaling to mitigate its limitations
•	Justify target selection based on:
o	Biological function
o	Pathway context
o	Expected impact on metabolic health and side-effect reduction
For each proposed target:
•	Specify the antibody modality (e.g., IgG, VHH, bispecific, combination therapy)
•	Describe the therapeutic strategy (e.g., GLP-1R agonist + novel antibody combination)
•	Discuss:
o	Expected improvements over GLP-1 monotherapy
o	Potential risks, trade-offs, or safety considerations
