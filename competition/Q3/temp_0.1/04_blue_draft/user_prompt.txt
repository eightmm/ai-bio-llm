Problem 3. [Identification of Next-Generation Antibody Targets to Overcome the Limitations of GLP-1R Agonists in Obesity Treatment]


Background
GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists have revolutionized the treatment of obesity, demonstrating unprecedented efficacy in body weight reduction. However, their clinical use is associated with significant limitations, including gastrointestinal adverse effects, nausea and vomiting, and loss of lean muscle mass. Moreover, GLP-1–based therapies do not fully address the complex compensatory physiological and metabolic pathways that counteract sustained weight loss.
Next-generation obesity therapeutics aim to go beyond simple weight reduction and instead focus on improving overall metabolic health while minimizing adverse effects. Achieving this goal requires a deeper understanding of the mechanistic limitations of GLP-1 signaling and the identification of novel therapeutic targets that can synergize with or complement GLP-1–based interventions.

# Next-Generation Antibody Therapeutics for Obesity: Addressing the Mechanistic and Clinical Limitations of GLP-1 Receptor Agonists

GLP-1 receptor agonists have fundamentally transformed obesity and type 2 diabetes treatment, achieving weight loss magnitudes previously attainable only through bariatric surgery[1][2]. Despite their unprecedented clinical efficacy, emerging clinical and mechanistic evidence reveals substantial limitations that prevent these agents from serving as optimal monotherapies for sustainable, well-tolerated obesity management. This report synthesizes current evidence on GLP-1R agonist limitations, maps the compensatory physiological pathways that counteract sustained weight loss, and proposes two next-generation antibody-based therapeutic targets designed to synergize with or complement GLP-1 signaling. The proposed approach addresses key unmet clinical needs: mitigation of gastrointestinal tolerability barriers, preservation of lean muscle mass, durability of weight loss, and improvement in metabolic health outcomes beyond glycemic control.

## Mechanistic and Clinical Limitations of GLP-1 Receptor Agonist Therapies

### Gastrointestinal Adverse Events and Their Impact on Treatment Adherence

Gastrointestinal adverse events remain the most frequent class of adverse effects associated with GLP-1 receptor agonist therapy, affecting between 40 and 85 percent of treated patients in pivotal clinical trials[1]. Among these events, nausea emerges systematically as the most prevalent adverse effect across all conducted trials, typically affecting 15 to 50 percent of patients, with prevalence being substantially higher during the first four to five weeks of treatment when gastric emptying is most significantly delayed[1]. The temporal pattern of nausea onset, peaking during the initial dose-escalation phase, reflects the pharmacodynamic mechanism by which GLP-1 receptor agonists slow gastric emptying to achieve glycemic and satiety benefits. However, this same mechanism that drives therapeutic efficacy becomes the primary driver of dose-limiting tolerability barriers.

The frequency of diarrhea varies considerably across clinical trials, generally ranging between 5 and 25 percent, with symptom onset typically occurring during the first four weeks of treatment after which incidence notably decreases[1]. In contrast, constipation exhibits a more protracted course, with symptoms persisting for a median duration of 47 days in patients with obesity treated with GLP-1R agonists, reflecting the more chronic nature of the dysfunction in gastric and intestinal motility[1]. The extended duration of constipation symptoms highlights a critical distinction between the mechanistic bases of different gastrointestinal adverse effects: while nausea and diarrhea represent transient responses to acute changes in gastric emptying and intestinal transit, constipation reflects sustained alterations in bowel motility that may require weeks to fully normalize. These diverse temporal profiles complicate dose-escalation strategies and necessitate individualized tolerability management approaches.

A particularly concerning finding involves the exacerbation of diarrhea in patients receiving concurrent metformin therapy, especially when omeprazole is also administered[1]. This drug-drug interaction highlights how GLP-1R agonists may amplify the effects of other agents that modify gut physiology and microbiota, creating a complex polypharmacy challenge in real-world clinical practice. The mechanistic basis likely involves GLP-1-mediated slowing of gastric emptying and modulation of small intestinal transit time in the context of altered gastric pH and microbial composition, demonstrating that GLP-1R agonist-induced GI effects are not isolated phenomena but rather components of integrated alterations in upper and lower gastrointestinal physiology.

### Lean Body Mass Loss: A Critical Mechanistic Limitation

The loss of lean body mass represents a mechanistically distinct limitation of GLP-1R agonist therapy with important implications for long-term physical function and metabolic health[2]. Clinical evidence demonstrates substantial heterogeneity in the proportion of total weight loss attributable to lean mass reductions, with some studies reporting lean mass losses representing 40 to 60 percent of total weight lost, while other investigations show lean mass reductions of approximately 15 percent or less of total weight lost[2]. This heterogeneity likely reflects differences in baseline patient characteristics, including age, disease severity, baseline physical activity, and nutritional status, as well as drug-specific and molecular characteristics affecting the balance between fat mass and lean mass mobilization.

Contemporary evidence integrating magnetic resonance imaging-based assessments suggests that skeletal muscle changes with GLP-1R agonist treatment appear to be predominantly adaptive in nature[2]. Reductions in muscle volume appear proportionate to what would be expected given aging, disease status, and the magnitude of weight loss achieved, and improvements in insulin sensitivity and muscle fat infiltration likely contribute to an adaptive process with improved muscle quality, thereby lowering the probability of concurrent losses in muscular strength and functional capacity[2]. However, the mechanistic understanding remains incomplete, and certain patient populations warrant particular concern. Older age and greater severity of metabolic disease may increase the risk of sarcopenia development during GLP-1R agonist therapy, suggesting that these agents may preferentially mobilize lean mass in vulnerable populations despite overall preservation of muscle quality[2].

### Weight Regain After GLP-1R Agonist Discontinuation: The Durability Problem

Weight regain following cessation of GLP-1R agonist therapy represents a critical mechanistic limitation stemming from the reversibility of drug-induced changes in appetite regulation and energy homeostasis[3][6]. Weight regain after weight loss is driven by complex biological adaptations including reduced resting energy expenditure, increased activity of appetite-regulating hormones such as ghrelin, reduced leptin signaling, lower peptide YY levels, and decreased energy expenditure, which collectively promote appetite and facilitate energy conservation[6]. While this rebound phenomenon is not unique to GLP-1R agonists—having been observed with other pharmacotherapies including orlistat and phentermine—the magnitude of weight regain following GLP-1R agonist cessation appears substantially more pronounced than with other weight loss interventions.

The meta-analytic evidence comprehensively demonstrates that GLP-1R agonists, particularly semaglutide and liraglutide, have demonstrated profound weight loss but also significant regain after cessation[6]. The mechanistic basis of this durability limitation relates fundamentally to the temporary nature of GLP-1R agonist-induced alterations in central nervous system appetite regulation. Studies have shown that GLP-1R agonists regulate food intake through stimulation of sensory neurons in the vagus nerve, interaction with the hypothalamus and hindbrain, and modulation of inflammation and intestinal microbiota[3]. These mechanisms operate through discrete neural circuits that remain dependent on ongoing GLP-1R agonist signaling for sustained appetitive suppression. Withdrawal of the agonist results in deregulation of these circuits and reversal of weight loss through compensatory increases in food intake driven by both homeostatic and hedonic feeding pathways.

Research examining the mechanisms by which GLP-1 influences weight regulation through central nervous system pathways has identified that GLP-1 agonists suppress appetite and promote satiety through activation of pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons while inhibiting agouti-related peptide/neuropeptide Y (AgRP/NPY) neurons in the arcuate nucleus[10]. This dynamic reprogramming of hypothalamic neural circuits depends critically on sustained GLP-1R signaling; cessation of GLP-1R agonist therapy permits reactivation of AgRP/NPY neurons and restoration of orexigenic (appetite-promoting) signaling. The temporal dynamics of this compensatory reactivation remain incompletely characterized in humans, but animal models suggest that restoration of AgRP neuron activity occurs relatively rapidly following withdrawal of GLP-1R antagonists, providing a biological basis for the observed rapid weight regain in some patients.

### Heterogeneity in Treatment Response and Genetic Factors

While GLP-1R agonists demonstrate class effects on weight loss across populations, there exists substantial heterogeneity in individual response, with some patients achieving near-maximal weight loss benefits while others experience minimal weight reduction[45][48]. Genetic variability in the GLP-1 receptor itself has been associated with inter-individual differences in weight-lowering potential of liraglutide in obese patients[45]. However, comprehensive multi-ancestry analyses of 10,960 individuals from nine biobank studies across six countries found that known genetic factors, including polygenic scores for body mass index and type 2 diabetes as well as coding variants in GLP1R, PCSK1, and APOE genes, have limited impact on GLP-1R agonist effectiveness with respect to weight change[48]. The average weight change between 6 and 12 months from GLP-1R agonist initiation was −3.93 percent, with marginal differences across genetic ancestries, suggesting that non-genetic factors, including adherence, baseline metabolic characteristics, and gastrointestinal tolerability, play predominant roles in determining treatment response.

### Tachyphylaxis to Gastric Emptying Effects

A mechanistically important but clinically underappreciated limitation of GLP-1R agonists involves tachyphylaxis (rapid tolerance development) to the gastric emptying delay induced by these agents[25]. Studies examining the GLP-1-induced deceleration of gastric emptying have demonstrated that this effect is significantly diminished already after five hours of continuous infusion compared with its initial effects[25]. This attenuation of GLP-1 efficacy leads to increased postprandial concentrations of glucose, insulin, and glucagon, as well as changes in the concentration-time pattern of glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP)[25]. The mechanisms underlying this rapid tolerance development appear to involve tachyphylaxis at the level of vagal nervous system activation rather than receptor downregulation, with plasma pancreatic polypeptide levels—thought to mirror systemic vagal activation—being markedly suppressed by GLP-1 during the initial nutrient load but becoming slightly elevated during subsequent nutrient loads, suggesting more pronounced inhibition of parasympathetic outflow during the first stimulus[25].

This tachyphylaxis to gastric emptying effects has important clinical implications for understanding both the tolerability profile and the durability of metabolic benefits from GLP-1R agonists. The fact that GLP-1 appears to inhibit gastric emptying primarily through inhibition of vagal nerve activity, a mechanism subject to rapid tachyphylaxis after chronic GLP-1 exposure, suggests that sustained postprandial glucose control may depend on non-motility effects of GLP-1, such as direct inhibition of glucagon secretion and stimulation of insulin secretion[25]. Furthermore, the short time course of tachyphylaxis development (within approximately five hours) raises questions about whether the symptomatic gastrointestinal adverse effects of GLP-1R agonists might similarly be subject to tolerance mechanisms that could be exploited through optimized dosing strategies.

## Compensatory Physiological and Metabolic Pathways Limiting Weight Loss Durability

### The Leptin-Ghrelin Axis and Appetite Homeostasis

The leptin-ghrelin-peptide YY axis represents the fundamental physiological system regulating appetite at the level of the central nervous system, and GLP-1R agonist-induced weight loss triggers substantial compensatory shifts in this axis that progressively counteract further weight loss and promote weight regain[12][33][50]. Leptin is secreted from adipocytes in proportion to body fat stores and acts on leptin receptors within the hypothalamus to suppress food intake and increase energy expenditure[33]. In contrast, ghrelin, secreted from the stomach and fundus, exerts the opposite effect, stimulating food intake and reducing energy expenditure[33]. During weight loss induced by GLP-1R agonists or other caloric restriction approaches, leptin levels decrease substantially, removing a critical tonic signal for appetite suppression and energy expenditure.

The temporal dynamics of leptin and ghrelin responses to weight loss provide important insights into the mechanisms of weight regain. A prospective study examining weight regain after diet-induced weight loss found that subjects with higher baseline plasma leptin and lower ghrelin levels were significantly more prone to regain lost weight[12]. Among individuals who regained more than 10 percent of the weight loss, leptin levels were substantially higher (P<0.01), whereas ghrelin levels were lower (P<0.05)[12]. Moreover, weight regain at follow-up was negatively correlated with ghrelin levels and positively associated with leptin levels both at baseline and at the endpoint of weight loss, demonstrating a gender-specific influence with the association being statistically significant among men for ghrelin and among women for leptin[12]. These findings underscore how the leptin-ghrelin axis exhibits substantial individual heterogeneity in its response to weight loss, creating diverse propensities for weight regain across the population.

Peptide YY (PYY), a 36-amino acid peptide synthesized and released from specialized enteroendocrine L-cells located within the distal gastrointestinal tract, constitutes a third critical component of the appetite homeostasis axis[50]. PYY is released into circulation in a nutrient-dependent manner, with levels remaining low in the fasting state but rapidly increasing in response to food intake, reaching a peak at one to two hours after a meal and then remaining elevated for several hours[50]. Low circulating PYY concentrations appear to predispose toward both the development and maintenance of obesity, with multiple lines of evidence suggesting that subjects with reduced postprandial PYY release exhibit lower satiety and that circulating PYY levels correlate negatively with markers of adiposity[50]. Mice lacking PYY are hyperphagic and become obese, demonstrating the critical role of this hormone in suppressing food intake[50]. The mechanistic basis likely involves PYY binding to Y2 receptors on AgRP neurons in the arcuate nucleus, thereby inhibiting these orexigenic neurons and promoting satiety signaling[10].

### Central Nervous System Regulation of Energy Expenditure and Sympathetic Outflow

Beyond appetite suppression, weight loss durability is substantially determined by compensatory reductions in resting energy expenditure, a phenomenon that develops progressively as weight loss is sustained[36][40]. A common frustration for individuals attempting to lose weight involves the marked compensatory reduction in energy expenditure associated with fasting or caloric restriction[36]. Early studies implicating AgRP and neuropeptide Y (NPY) in food intake and energy expenditure revealed that NPY, given intracerebroventricularly or intra-paraventricular nucleus, is associated with reduced energy expenditure, an effect due in part to reduced sympathetic outflow to thermogenic tissues such as brown adipose tissue[36]. Activation of AgRP neurons leads to a rapid switch in substrate use, decreasing fat utilization and increasing systemic glucose utilization independent of food intake changes[36]. These metabolic shifts represent adaptive responses to perceived energy scarcity, wherein the organism attempts to conserve energy stores by reducing energy expenditure and favoring glucose-sparing pathways.

The sympathetic nervous system (SNS) represents a critical mediator of adaptive thermogenesis and energy expenditure regulation, with direct control over brown adipose tissue activation and white adipose tissue browning[40]. Brown adipose tissue dissipates energy through nonshivering thermogenesis, a process mediated by the unique expression of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) in the inner mitochondrial membrane of brown adipocytes[40]. Sustained SNS drive facilitates a systemic transition of adipose tissue from an energy-storing to an energy-expending phenotype through accumulation of thermogenic brown adipocytes, UCP1 activation, decreased proliferation of white adipocytes, browning of subcutaneous white adipose tissue, and increased lipolysis to provide the required energy[40]. However, weight loss-induced reductions in leptin signaling result in diminished central sympathetic outflow to adipose depots, thereby reducing brown adipose tissue thermogenesis and the capacity for white adipose tissue browning. This compensatory reduction in SNS tone directly counteracts the weight loss-promoting effects of GLP-1R agonists, creating a fundamental mechanistic limitation to sustained weight reduction.

### The Hedonic Feeding Circuit and Reward-Based Appetite Regulation

Beyond the homeostatic appetitive systems controlled by the hypothalamus and brainstem, the mesolimbic reward circuitry comprising the ventral tegmental area (VTA), nucleus accumbens core and shell, and basolateral amygdala (BLA) exerts profound influence over food-seeking behavior and caloric intake[26]. Oxytocin, a neuropeptide synthesized in hypothalamic paraventricular and supraoptic neurons with widespread projections to reward circuits, has emerged as a critical regulator of hedonic feeding behavior[26]. Oxytocin neurons express the receptor for leptin, and administration of leptin at doses that support hypophagia activates oxytocin neurons[26]. Anorexigenic glucagon-like peptide-1 and adrenomedullin increase oxytocin neuronal activity and/or promote neurohypophyseal release of oxytocin[26]. Oxytocin injected directly into the ventral tegmental area, nucleus accumbens core, and basolateral amygdala in rats decreases the intake of episodically presented palatable sweet solutions, suggesting a role for oxytocin in suppressing the reward-driven appetite for high-caloric foods[26].

During sustained weight loss, reduced leptin signaling in oxytocin neurons diminishes oxytocin-mediated suppression of hedonic feeding. Moreover, the neural circuitry governing reward-based food intake exhibits plasticity in response to chronic palatable diet consumption. Chronicity of palatable diet presentation may constitute a mitigating factor in the responsiveness of oxytocin neurons to food load; occasional episodic intake of high-sugar diets in rodents engages more paraventricular nucleus oxytocin neurons than low-sugar food, yet daily habitual intake of sugary food promotes a significant decline in the level of activation of oxytocin cells[26]. This adaptation of the oxytocin system to chronic exposure of palatable foods suggests that GLP-1R agonist-induced suppression of hedonic feeding may exhibit its own form of tolerance, with sustained administration potentially leading to blunting of the anorexigenic effects on reward circuitry.

### Adaptive Immunity and Metaflammation as Compensatory Responses to Weight Loss

Obesity is characterized by chronic low-grade inflammation of adipose tissue, termed "metaflammation," which is closely linked to insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction[21][24]. The inflammatory state in obesity arises from multiple sources, including adipose tissue macrophages exhibiting a pro-inflammatory (M1-like) phenotype, infiltration of CD8+ T cells and γδ T cells with predominantly pro-inflammatory characteristics, and systemic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure through metabolic endotoxemia[21]. The signature pro-inflammatory cytokines in obesity-associated inflammation—tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β)—are upregulated in adipose tissue and directly contribute to insulin resistance through activation of IKK/nuclear factor-κB and JAK/STAT signaling cascades[21].

Weight loss induced by GLP-1R agonists characteristically improves markers of inflammation, with reductions in C-reactive protein and pro-inflammatory cytokines correlating with metabolic improvements[44]. However, the inflammatory milieu undergoes substantial remodeling during weight loss, and the trajectory of changes in inflammation following GLP-1R agonist cessation remains inadequately characterized. The long-term sustainability of anti-inflammatory benefits following GLP-1R agonist discontinuation remains unknown, raising the possibility that compensatory re-activation of pro-inflammatory pathways might contribute to weight regain and loss of metabolic improvements.

## Identified Compensatory Nodes Insufficiently Addressed by GLP-1R Agonist Monotherapy

Based on systematic integration of the limitations and compensatory pathways outlined above, six primary compensatory nodes emerge as functionally relevant to obesity and metabolic regulation but insufficiently suppressed or modulated by GLP-1 monotherapy: (1) skeletal muscle protein homeostasis and myostatin/activin signaling; (2) brown adipose tissue thermogenesis and sympathetic nervous system regulation of energy expenditure; (3) the leptin-ghrelin-PYY-oxytocin axis governing appetite homeostasis and hedonic feeding; (4) hepatic lipogenesis and fibroblast growth factor 21 signaling; (5) gastrointestinal motility and gastroenteroendocrine cell function independent of GLP-1R signaling; and (6) adaptive immune responses and macrophage polarization in adipose tissue.

Of these six nodes, skeletal muscle protein homeostasis emerges as the highest-priority target for next-generation therapeutic intervention. The mechanistic rationale is compelling: GLP-1R agonists do not directly target the myostatin/activin type II receptor signaling pathway that represents the primary negative regulator of skeletal muscle mass and function, yet the substantial lean mass losses accompanying GLP-1R agonist therapy—potentially up to 40-60 percent of total weight loss in some patient populations—indicate that muscle catabolism is a major contributor to overall weight reduction. By combining GLP-1R agonist therapy with blockade of myostatin and activin signaling through inhibition of activin type II receptors, substantially greater preservation of lean mass while achieving equivalent or even greater fat mass reduction becomes mechanistically plausible. The second highest-priority compensatory node involves brown adipose tissue thermogenesis and sympathetic nervous system regulation of energy expenditure. The weight regain observed after GLP-1R agonist cessation reflects not merely restoration of appetite but also compensatory reductions in resting energy expenditure driven by diminished sympathetic outflow to thermogenic tissues. Therapeutic interventions that enhance brown adipose tissue activation or increase the transcription and activity of thermogenic genes in white adipose tissue could substantially enhance the durability of weight loss.

## Next-Generation Antibody Targets and Proposed Therapeutic Strategies

### Target 1: Activin Type II Receptor (ActRII) Blockade for Lean Mass Preservation and Enhanced Body Composition

**Biological Rationale and Mechanistic Synergy with GLP-1R Agonists**

The myostatin/activin type II receptor (ActRII) pathway has been identified as critical in regulating skeletal muscle size, with myostatin, GDF11, and activins A and B serving as ligands that bind to and signal through either the ActRIIA or ActRIIB receptor on the cell membrane[54]. Upon binding to ActRII, the ligand and type II receptor form a complex with a type I receptor (either activin receptor-like kinase 4 or ALK5) to stimulate phosphorylation of the Smad2 and Smad3 transcription factors[54]. Myostatin's inhibition of muscle differentiation and hypertrophy occurs at least partially through a Smad2/3 phosphorylation-dependent blockade of the AKT-mTOR pathway; treatment of muscle with myostatin or activin results in decreased levels of phosphorylated AKT, which is required for muscle differentiation in myoblasts and mediates muscle hypertrophy in myofibers[54].

Blockade of ActRII through antagonizing antibodies dramatically increases skeletal muscle mass beyond what is achieved by sole inhibition of myostatin[54]. Administration of soluble ActRIIB led to muscle hypertrophy in both normal and myostatin-knockout mice, demonstrating that ligands in addition to myostatin—particularly activin A—normally function to limit muscle growth through ActRII signaling[54]. The capacity for modulating muscle growth by perturbing ActRII signaling at the receptor level is much greater than that achieved by blocking myostatin alone, suggesting that dual blockade of both ActRIIA and ActRIIB provides superior therapeutic benefit compared to selective inhibition of individual receptors[15].

Recent clinical evidence demonstrates the remarkable synergistic potential of combining ActRII blockade with GLP-1R agonist therapy for obesity treatment. The BELIEVE Phase 2b trial evaluated the effects of bimagrumab—a first-in-class monoclonal antibody targeting activin type II receptors—administered alone and in combination with semaglutide in adults with overweight or obesity[5][14]. Bimagrumab alone resulted in 100 percent of weight loss being attributed to fat mass with a 2.5 percent increase in total lean mass[5]. When combined with semaglutide, the bimagrumab-semaglutide combination therapy yielded 92.8 percent of total weight loss from fat mass (compared to semaglutide alone yielding 71.8 percent from fat) and a 22.1 percent decrease in bodyweight (compared to −10.8 percent for bimagrumab alone and −15.7 percent for semaglutide alone)[5][14]. The researchers conducting the BELIEVE study concluded that these findings represent a major step forward in obesity treatment, demonstrating that it is not only possible to achieve substantial fat loss but also to preserve or even enhance lean mass in the process[5].

The mechanistic synergy between GLP-1R agonists and ActRII antagonists operates through distinct but complementary pathways. GLP-1R agonists reduce overall energy intake through appetite suppression and promote satiety, thereby creating a caloric deficit that drives weight loss. In the context of untreated myostatin/activin signaling, this caloric deficit triggers substantial muscle catabolism through myostatin/activin-mediated inhibition of protein synthesis and promotion of protein degradation in myofibers. By antagonizing ActRII, bimagrumab simultaneously suppresses the negative regulation of muscle mass, allowing myofibers to maintain or even increase protein synthesis while fat stores are being mobilized and oxidized. This dual mechanism—simultaneous suppression of appetite/food intake through GLP-1R agonism and suppression of muscle catabolism through ActRII antagonism—represents a fundamentally more sophisticated approach to obesity treatment than GLP-1R agonism alone.

**Proposed Antibody Modality and Combination Therapeutic Strategy**

Bimagrumab represents the lead ActRII antagonist antibody currently in clinical development for obesity treatment, having demonstrated the synergistic benefits documented in the BELIEVE trial. Bimagrumab is engineered as a fully human monoclonal IgG antibody with dual specificity for both ActRIIA and ActRIIB, binding to both receptors' ligand-binding domains in a competitive manner at the critical myostatin/activin binding site, thus preventing signal transduction through either ActRII[15]. The necessity for simultaneous engagement and neutralization of both ActRIIs confers unique therapeutic potential to bimagrumab, as blocking individual ActRII subtypes alone produces substantially less robust muscle anabolism compared to dual blockade[15]. The half-life of bimagrumab has been optimized through conventional Fc engineering approaches, permitting less frequent dosing schedules suitable for combination with weekly GLP-1R agonist injections.

The proposed therapeutic strategy involves fixed-dose combination administration of semaglutide (or potentially other long-acting GLP-1R agonists) with intravenous infusion of bimagrumab at specified intervals (weeks 4, 16, 28, and 40 in the BELIEVE trial protocol)[5]. This sequential dosing approach capitalizes on the distinct pharmacokinetic profiles of the two agents while minimizing polypharmacy complexity. The subcutaneous once-weekly semaglutide injection can be administered on a consistent schedule (e.g., every Monday morning), while bimagrumab infusions are scheduled at broader intervals. Alternative approaches under investigation include development of bispecific antibodies conjugating GLP-1R agonist function with ActRII antagonism, though such bispecific approaches remain in early preclinical development and have not yet demonstrated clinical proof-of-concept in obesity indications.

**Expected Improvements Over GLP-1R Agonist Monotherapy and Mechanistic Impact on Key Limitations**

The combination of semaglutide with bimagrumab directly addresses the lean mass loss limitation of GLP-1R agonist monotherapy. The BELIEVE trial demonstrated that semaglutide alone resulted in 71.8 percent of weight loss from fat mass (meaning 28.2 percent from lean mass), whereas the bimagrumab-semaglutide combination achieved 92.8 percent of weight loss from fat mass (with only 7.2 percent from lean mass)[5]. This represents a dramatic shift in body composition, with the combination therapy achieving substantially greater preferential mobilization of fat stores while preserving lean tissue. For a patient achieving 15 kg of weight loss with semaglutide monotherapy (with approximately 4.2 kg from lean mass and 10.8 kg from fat), the same total weight loss with bimagrumab-semaglutide combination would result in approximately 14.0 kg from fat mass and only 1.0 kg from lean mass—a nearly 4-fold reduction in lean mass loss.

Beyond the direct preservation of lean mass, the combination approach has potential implications for durability of weight loss and reduced weight regain following treatment discontinuation. Skeletal muscle tissue exhibits lower energy density than adipose tissue and requires substantial daily energy expenditure for maintenance, with muscle protein turnover representing a significant component of resting energy expenditure. Preservation of lean mass during weight loss therefore contributes to maintenance of resting metabolic rate, reducing the compensatory decline in energy expenditure that typically follows weight loss and contributes to weight regain. In contrast, GLP-1R agonist-induced lean mass loss results in a lower resting metabolic rate at the reduced body weight, predisposing to rapid weight regain when appetite suppression diminishes following drug discontinuation. By preserving lean mass, the bimagrumab-semaglutide combination may mitigate this fundamental durability limitation.

The combination approach additionally has potential benefits for cardiometabolic endpoints beyond weight loss. Skeletal muscle represents a critical insulin-sensitive tissue, and loss of lean mass during weight loss is associated with impaired improvements in whole-body insulin sensitivity despite preferential mobilization of visceral fat. Preservation of lean mass through ActRII antagonism may enhance improvements in insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis, though this hypothesis requires prospective clinical validation. Moreover, maintenance of skeletal muscle mass has important implications for physical function, quality of life, and prevention of sarcopenia in aging populations and those with significant baseline physical limitations.

**Safety Considerations and Risk Mitigation Strategies**

The ActRII antagonism approach requires careful consideration of potential on-target and off-target biological effects. Myostatin and activins signal through ActRII to regulate not only skeletal muscle but also cardiac muscle, bone, and immune function[15]. In preclinical studies, bimagrumab has been well-tolerated at doses substantially exceeding those required for maximum skeletal muscle anabolism, with careful attention paid to cardiac muscle growth and function. However, the chronic effects of sustained ActRII antagonism on cardiac structure and function in humans with obesity remain incompletely characterized and warrant careful prospective monitoring in clinical trials.

Activin A has been identified as an important regulator of immune cell differentiation and inflammatory responses, with activin signaling through ActRII implicated in both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory pathways depending on cellular context[15]. The long-term immunological consequences of sustained ActRII antagonism in obese patients require careful characterization, including monitoring of infection rates, vaccine responses, and development of autoimmune phenomena. The combination of GLP-1R agonist therapy—which itself exerts immunomodulatory effects including reductions in pro-inflammatory cytokines and changes in immune cell populations—with ActRII antagonism creates a complex pharmacological situation requiring systematic immunotoxicology evaluation.

The proposed dose titration strategy for bimagrumab-semaglutide combination therapy should employ a gradual escalation of bimagrumab dosing, with close monitoring of lean mass changes via dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) imaging and assessment of skeletal muscle strength and function via standardized testing protocols (e.g., hand-grip strength, chair stand test, gait speed). Regular cardiac monitoring including echocardiography at baseline and at specified intervals during therapy should be implemented to detect any changes in cardiac structure or function. A biomarker plan incorporating measures of muscle protein turnover (creatine kinase, myoglobin, amino acid profiles) and immune function (lymphocyte subsets, inflammatory cytokines, immunoglobulin levels) should be established. Preclinical packages including comprehensive pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics assessments, evaluation of myostatin and activin signaling in relevant tissues (muscle, heart, bone), and immunotoxicology studies in non-human primates should be completed before advancing to large Phase III trials.

### Target 2: TGR5 Receptor Agonism via Monoclonal Antibodies or Antibody-FGF21 Fusion for Enhanced Energy Expenditure and Improved Gastrointestinal Tolerability

**Biological Rationale and Mechanistic Synergy with GLP-1R Agonists**

The Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5 (TGR5), also designated as GPR131 or GPBAR1, represents an emerging therapeutic target with multiple biological functions relevant to obesity and metabolic health[38][41]. TGR5 is a membrane-bound G protein-coupled receptor initially identified as a receptor for bile acids but subsequently recognized to have numerous metabolic functions including increasing basal metabolic rate, improving whole-body nutrient tolerance, and modulating postprandial metabolic state[41]. Most of the systemic metabolic effects attributed to bile acids are regulated by TGR5, including prevention of obesity, insulin resistance, liver steatosis, and atherosclerosis[38].

Bile acids are hepatically synthesized cholesterol derivatives that function as both amphipathic surfactants and systemic endocrine hormones, regulating not only their own synthesis and enterohepatic circulation but also serving as potent modulators of macronutrient metabolism and the systemic pro-inflammatory/anti-inflammatory balance[41]. The canonical bile acid receptors, farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and TGR5, exhibit differential tissue expression and signaling cascade activation, with TGR5 being particularly important for the metabolic effects of bile acids in extra-hepatic tissues[41]. Notably, the composition of the bile acid pool—specifically the relative proportions of different bile acid species—determines the relative engagement of FXR versus TGR5, with secondary bile acids such as deoxycholic acid and lithocholic acid being the most potent TGR5 agonists[41].

The mechanistic foundation for TGR5-targeted therapy in obesity treatment rests on multiple complementary pathways. Activation of TGR5 expressed by intestinal endocrine L-cells promotes the secretion of glucagon-like peptide-1, creating a direct mechanistic link between TGR5 signaling and GLP-1 secretion[38]. TGR5 activation expressed in extraintestinal tissues directly enhances energy expenditure through activation of the TGR5-type 2 deiodinase (D2) pathway, which effectively promotes the expression of thermogenic genes and stimulates energy consumption of both brown adipose tissue and skeletal muscle, as well as oxidative phosphorylation of mitochondria[38]. TGR5 agonists have been shown to effectively improve liver steatosis and insulin sensitivity in mice fed a Western diet, and have demonstrated therapeutic potential for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis[38]. Moreover, TGR5 is widely expressed in immune cells and plays a crucial role in regulating inflammatory responses through mechanisms including upregulation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate in alveolar macrophages and suppression of Toll-like receptor 4 signaling, thereby reducing the production of pro-inflammatory factors induced by lipopolysaccharide[38].

The proposed mechanistic synergy between GLP-1R agonism and TGR5 agonism operates through both complementary appetite-suppressive mechanisms and through distinct energy expenditure pathways. While GLP-1R agonists suppress appetite through central nervous system mechanisms and reduce gastric emptying, TGR5 activation in intestinal L-cells provides an additional, independent stimulus for GLP-1 secretion while simultaneously enhancing energy expenditure through sympathetic nervous system activation of brown adipose tissue. Furthermore, TGR5 activation in immune cells suppresses pro-inflammatory pathways that are implicated in obesity-associated insulin resistance and that may contribute to the gastrointestinal adverse effects of GLP-1R agonists through effects on intestinal motility and barrier function. The reduction of metaflammation through TGR5 agonism may therefore attenuate not only systemic insulin resistance but also gastrointestinal inflammation that could underlie nausea and other GI adverse effects of GLP-1R agonist therapy.

**Proposed Antibody Modality and Combination Therapeutic Strategy**

The proposed antibody approach to TGR5 agonism represents a novel application of antibody therapeutics to a G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway. Rather than developing traditional antagonist antibodies to block TGR5 function, the therapeutic strategy involves engineering agonist antibodies or antibody-peptide fusion proteins that directly activate TGR5 signaling in target tissues. This represents a departure from conventional antibody-based therapeutics that typically target extracellular ligands or antagonize receptor function, but recent advances in antibody engineering have demonstrated the feasibility of engineering antibodies as functional agonists for GPCR targets[55]. 

An alternative, potentially more tractable approach involves development of antibody-fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) fusion proteins that combine the long half-life and tissue distribution properties of monoclonal antibodies with the metabolic effects of FGF21, a potent metabolic regulator with complementary effects to GLP-1R agonism. FGF21 is an endocrine hormone that controls key metabolic processes and induces the synthesis of glucose transporters, increasing glucose absorption levels in fat cells[30]. FGF21 is expressed in multiple metabolically active organs and tissues, and mounting evidence indicates that exogenous administration of FGF21 has beneficial metabolic effects including weight loss and resolution of hepatic triglyceride accumulation in type 2 diabetes, steatohepatitis, and cardiovascular disease[30]. Notably, FGF21 exhibits a weak FGF21 circadian rhythm in obese individuals, with basal serum FGF21 concentrations being higher in obese individuals than in lean individuals, but with mean amplitudes (peak-to-nadir ratio) in the obese group being significantly smaller, demonstrating blunting of the nocturnal FGF21 rise in obesity[27].

The proposed therapeutic strategy involves engineering a bispecific antibody or antibody-peptide fusion that combines FGF21 receptor agonism (through engineering an antibody-FGF21 fusion or through bispecific antibodies targeting FGF21 receptor and its coreceptor β-klotho) with blockade of an anti-anabolic pathway (potentially myostatin/GDF11, creating a triple-targeted approach). Alternatively, a simpler approach involves engineering a conventional long-acting FGF21 analog using antibody Fc fusion technology to extend the half-life from the naturally short duration of native FGF21 (minutes to hours) to a more clinically suitable half-life of days to weeks, permitting less frequent dosing. This FGF21-Fc fusion or an engineered FGF21 variant conjugated to an antibody could then be administered in combination with a GLP-1R agonist (semaglutide or liraglutide) on a coordinated dosing schedule.

**Expected Improvements Over GLP-1R Agonist Monotherapy and Mechanistic Impact on Key Limitations**

The TGR5 agonism approach (whether through direct TGR5 agonist antibodies or through FGF21-mediated mechanisms) directly addresses multiple key limitations of GLP-1R agonist monotherapy. First, TGR5 activation in intestinal endocrine cells provides an additional stimulus for endogenous GLP-1 secretion, potentially amplifying appetite suppression beyond what GLP-1R agonist alone achieves while simultaneously reducing the dependence on pharmacologically induced GLP-1 levels. This mechanistic amplification could potentially reduce the required dose of GLP-1R agonist, thereby attenuating gastrointestinal adverse effects while maintaining weight loss efficacy.

Second, TGR5 agonism directly enhances energy expenditure through activation of brown adipose tissue thermogenesis and browning of white adipose tissue[38]. While GLP-1R agonists primarily suppress appetite and create a caloric deficit, they do not directly enhance thermogenic energy expenditure. By combining GLP-1R agonists with TGR5 agonists or FGF21, the obesity treatment becomes a dual-mode intervention that suppresses caloric intake while simultaneously increasing caloric expenditure. This dual approach would be predicted to produce greater weight loss than either agent alone and to potentially increase the margin between intended weight loss and compensatory reductions in energy expenditure, thereby improving weight loss durability.

Third, TGR5 agonism reduces adipose tissue and systemic inflammation through suppression of macrophage pro-inflammatory activation and Toll-like receptor 4 signaling[38]. By reducing the inflammatory milieu, TGR5 agonism may attenuate the gastrointestinal adverse effects of GLP-1R agonists, as metaflammation and intestinal inflammation have been implicated in altered gastric emptying and intestinal motility. The reduction of systemic metaflammation through TGR5 agonism would additionally improve peripheral insulin sensitivity independent of weight loss, contributing to improvements in overall metabolic health.

Fourth, FGF21 exhibits direct hepatoprotective effects, improving hepatic steatosis and reducing hepatic triglyceride content independent of weight loss[27][30]. Since GLP-1R agonists exert hepatoprotective effects primarily through weight loss-related mechanisms and improvements in insulin sensitivity, the addition of FGF21 to GLP-1R agonist therapy would provide complementary hepatoprotective benefits through direct FGF21 signaling in hepatocytes and enhanced hepatic glucose metabolism and lipid oxidation. This combination approach would be particularly beneficial in patients with existing nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, a highly prevalent comorbidity in obesity populations.

**Safety Considerations and Risk Mitigation Strategies**

TGR5 agonism presents a distinct safety profile compared to ActRII antagonism, though careful monitoring remains essential. The primary safety concern involves potential effects of TGR5 agonism on bile acid metabolism and enterohepatic circulation. While TGR5 activation enhances farnesoid X receptor (FXR) signaling in a complementary manner, sustained TGR5 agonism could theoretically disrupt the tight homeostatic balance governing bile acid synthesis, secretion, and reabsorption. Pre-clinical studies and clinical trials of selective TGR5 agonists (such as INT-777) have demonstrated generally favorable safety profiles without major disruptions of bile acid homeostasis or lipid absorption, but the long-term effects of sustained TGR5 agonism in the context of combined GLP-1R agonism warrant careful characterization.

FGF21 presents additional considerations regarding potential metabolic effects on glucose homeostasis. Native FGF21 and FGF21 analogs have been associated with transient increases in uric acid levels in some studies, raising theoretical concerns about gout precipitation, though clinical experience with FGF21 analogs has not demonstrated increased gout incidence at clinically relevant doses. Moreover, FGF21 exerts effects on glucose metabolism that are distinct from and potentially complementary to GLP-1R agonism; while GLP-1R agonists enhance glucose-dependent insulin secretion, FGF21 enhances insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle independently of insulin secretion. The combination of these effects could theoretically increase hypoglycemia risk in patients also receiving insulin or sulfonylureas, necessitating careful patient selection and dose adjustment strategies.

The proposed biomarker monitoring plan for TGR5-agonist/FGF21-based therapy should incorporate regular assessment of bile acid levels (primary and secondary bile acids), fasting and postprandial glucose and insulin levels, assessment of hepatic function via liver enzymes and imaging (ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging), adipose tissue inflammation markers (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, TNF-α), brown adipose tissue activity if feasible (PET imaging with 18F-FDG in selected patients), and serum uric acid levels. Preclinical packages should include comprehensive characterization of TGR5 and FGF21 signaling in relevant tissues, evaluation of potential effects on bile acid homeostasis using radiolabeled bile acids in animal models, cardiovascular safety assessment (given reported bradycardia with some FGF21 analogs), and immunogenicity assessment (particularly important for antibody-FGF21 fusion proteins, which may induce anti-drug antibodies).

## Integration of Proposed Therapeutic Targets into Clinical Development Strategies

The two proposed next-generation therapeutic approaches—ActRII blockade for lean mass preservation and TGR5 agonism/FGF21 for enhanced energy expenditure and reduced inflammation—represent complementary strategies that could be developed through either sequential or simultaneous clinical development pathways. A near-term clinical development strategy would prioritize advancement of bimagrumab-semaglutide combination therapy, given the completion of the BELIEVE Phase 2b trial demonstrating clinical proof-of-concept and the identification of clear next steps for Phase III development. Concurrently, clinical development of TGR5-agonist or FGF21-based approaches should progress through early Phase I and Phase IIa studies characterizing safety, tolerability, and target engagement in the context of GLP-1R agonist cotherapy.

A longer-term vision involves development of triple-combination therapies addressing three key pathways: GLP-1 receptor signaling (appetite suppression and gastric emptying), ActRII blockade (lean mass preservation), and either TGR5 agonism or FGF21 (energy expenditure enhancement and inflammation reduction). Such triple-combination approaches would require careful pharmacological characterization and Phase II dose-escalation and pharmacodynamic studies to optimize dosing schedules and monitor for potential adverse effects, but represent the potential apex of rationally designed multimodal obesity therapeutics.

## Conclusion

GLP-1 receptor agonists have fundamentally transformed obesity treatment through their unprecedented efficacy in promoting weight loss and improving multiple cardiometabolic endpoints. However, substantial mechanistic and clinical limitations—including gastrointestinal adverse effects, lean mass loss, compensatory pathways limiting weight loss durability, and heterogeneity in treatment response—remain unresolved by monotherapy approaches. This comprehensive analysis has identified key compensatory physiological pathways that counteract sustained weight loss and proposed two next-generation antibody-based therapeutic targets designed to address these limitations through mechanistic synergy with GLP-1 signaling.

Activin type II receptor antagonism via bimagrumab represents an evidence-based near-term strategy for dramatically improving the body composition outcomes of obesity treatment by preserving lean muscle mass while achieving equivalent or greater fat mass reduction compared to GLP-1R agonist monotherapy. The BELIEVE trial provides strong clinical proof-of-concept for this approach, with the combination of bimagrumab and semaglutide achieving 92.8 percent of weight loss from fat mass compared to 71.8 percent for semaglutide monotherapy. Advancement of this approach into Phase III development should be prioritized, with careful attention to cardiac monitoring and immunological assessment.

TGR5 agonism or FGF21-based therapeutic strategies offer a complementary approach addressing the energy expenditure limitation of GLP-1R agonist monotherapy. By enhancing thermogenic energy expenditure while simultaneously reducing systemic inflammation and improving hepatic metabolic health, TGR5 agonism or FGF21 administration would address multiple unmet clinical needs and potentially improve the durability of weight loss following treatment discontinuation. Clinical development of these approaches should proceed through systematic Phase I and II investigations characterizing target engagement, metabolic effects, and potential mechanisms of action in the context of GLP-1R agonist cotherapy.

The field of obesity therapeutics has entered an era of sophisticated, rationally designed multimodal pharmacotherapy wherein combination approaches targeting complementary pathways offer the potential to achieve superior metabolic outcomes while minimizing adverse effects and improving overall treatment tolerability and durability. The proposed ActRII antagonist and TGR5 agonist/FGF21 strategies represent scientifically grounded next steps in this evolution, with the potential to substantially advance obesity treatment beyond the current limitations of monotherapy approaches.
