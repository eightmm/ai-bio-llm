Problem 2. [Predicting Cellular Aging and Disease Progression from TERRA Modification Patterns]

TERRA (Telomeric Repeat-containing RNA) plays a critical role in regulating telomere length, replication stability, and genome integrity. Emerging evidence suggests that specific RNA modification patterns—such as m6A, pseudouridine, and m5C—on TERRA molecules may serve as early molecular indicators of cellular aging and disease progression.
In this problem, you are asked to design an AI-based multimodal predictive framework that infers cellular aging status or disease progression probability from TERRA modification patterns, and explicitly visualizes the functional contribution of individual RNA modifications.

Objective
Design an integrated predictive framework that:
1.	Predicts cellular aging or disease progression probability from TERRA-related multi-omics data
2.	Quantifies and visualizes the functional contribution of individual RNA modification types
3.	Provides mechanistic interpretability linking molecular features to biological pathways

Task
You must propose a framework that includes all three modules (A–C) described below.
For each module, clearly specify:
1.	Data types and AI tools used, with scientific justification
2.	Alternative design choices and why they were not selected
3.	How the module’s outputs feed into the next stage

Module A: Multimodal Data Integration and Normalization
Integrate heterogeneous data sources related to TERRA biology into a unified representation.

Data Modalities (examples)
•	Transcriptomic data
o	Total RNA-seq
o	Single-cell RNA-seq
•	Epigenetic / RNA modification data
o	RNA modification maps (e.g., m6A, Ψ, m5C)
o	MeRIP-seq / miCLIP
o	ChIP-seq related to telomere-associated factors
•	Imaging data
o	Telomere FISH
o	TERRA RNA-FISH
o	Super-resolution imaging (STED / SIM)-derived telomere morphology metrics

Module B: Predictive Model Design
Design a model that transforms the integrated multimodal representation into aging or disease probability predictions.

Module C: Model Interpretation and Evaluation
Explain how model predictions are interpreted and evaluated.
