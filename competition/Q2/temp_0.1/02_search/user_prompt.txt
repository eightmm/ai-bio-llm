You are given structured information describing a scientific research problem.

## Problem Description
Problem 2. [Predicting Cellular Aging and Disease Progression from TERRA Modification Patterns]

TERRA (Telomeric Repeat-containing RNA) plays a critical role in regulating telomere length, replication stability, and genome integrity. Emerging evidence suggests that specific RNA modification patterns—such as m6A, pseudouridine, and m5C—on TERRA molecules may serve as early molecular indicators of cellular aging and disease progression.
In this problem, you are asked to design an AI-based multimodal predictive framework that infers cellular aging status or disease progression probability from TERRA modification patterns, and explicitly visualizes the functional contribution of individual RNA modifications.

Objective
Design an integrated predictive framework that:
1.	Predicts cellular aging or disease progression probability from TERRA-related multi-omics data
2.	Quantifies and visualizes the functional contribution of individual RNA modification types
3.	Provides mechanistic interpretability linking molecular features to biological pathways

Task
You must propose a framework that includes all three modules (A–C) described below.
For each module, clearly specify:
1.	Data types and AI tools used, with scientific justification
2.	Alternative design choices and why they were not selected
3.	How the module’s outputs feed into the next stage

Module A: Multimodal Data Integration and Normalization
Integrate heterogeneous data sources related to TERRA biology into a unified representation.

Data Modalities (examples)
•	Transcriptomic data
o	Total RNA-seq
o	Single-cell RNA-seq
•	Epigenetic / RNA modification data
o	RNA modification maps (e.g., m6A, Ψ, m5C)
o	MeRIP-seq / miCLIP
o	ChIP-seq related to telomere-associated factors
•	Imaging data
o	Telomere FISH
o	TERRA RNA-FISH
o	Super-resolution imaging (STED / SIM)-derived telomere morphology metrics

Module B: Predictive Model Design
Design a model that transforms the integrated multimodal representation into aging or disease probability predictions.

Module C: Model Interpretation and Evaluation
Explain how model predictions are interpreted and evaluated. 


## Core Objective
Design an AI-based multimodal predictive framework that integrates TERRA-related multi-omics (including RNA modification maps and imaging) to predict cellular aging status or disease progression probability, while quantitatively attributing and visualizing the functional contribution of individual RNA modification types (e.g., m6A, pseudouridine, m5C) and providing mechanistic interpretability via biological pathways.

[List of Sub-Problems to Address]
- [A_Multimodal_Integration_Normalization] Module A: Multimodal Data Integration and Normalization for TERRA Biology
  Description: Specify how to ingest, QC, normalize, and align heterogeneous TERRA-related modalities (bulk RNA-seq, scRNA-seq, RNA modification maps from MeRIP-seq/miCLIP, ChIP-seq for telomere-associated factors, and telomere/TERRA imaging such as FISH and super-resolution morphology metrics) into a unified representation suitable for downstream prediction. Include: (1) exact data types and feature engineering choices per modality (e.g., site-level vs region-level modification features; telomere morphology descriptors vs learned embeddings), and AI tools used with scientific justification; (2) alternative integration choices and why they are not selected (e.g., early fusion vs late fusion; MOFA+ vs deep generative integration; handcrafted imaging features vs self-supervised embeddings); (3) the output interface (unified latent space and/or modality-specific embeddings with alignment) and how it will be passed to Module B.
  Approach: 1) Preprocessing/QC per modality: 
- Bulk RNA-seq: normalization (DESeq2 size factors or TPM+log1p), batch correction (ComBat-seq) if needed.
- scRNA-seq: scVI/totalVI for denoising + batch correction; optional cell-state summarization to sample-level via pseudo-bulk or attention pooling.
- RNA modification maps (m6A/Ψ/m5C): call peaks/sites; convert to features such as (i) TERRA-specific modification density (per telomeric repeat unit, subtelomeric regions), (ii) peak intensity/stoichiometry proxies, (iii) motif-context features, (iv) co-occurrence patterns across modification types.
- ChIP-seq: peaks/coverage over telomere-adjacent regions and telomere-factor loci; summarize to region-level signals.
- Imaging (telomere FISH, TERRA RNA-FISH, STED/SIM): segment foci (Cellpose/StarDist), compute morphology metrics (count, intensity, spatial clustering, colocalization), and/or learn embeddings using a Vision Transformer (ViT) or CNN; consider self-supervised pretraining (DINOv2/MAE) to reduce label needs.

2) Multimodal alignment/integration:
- Preferred: a multimodal variational framework (multimodal VAE) or contrastive alignment (CLIP-style) to align modalities into a shared latent space while retaining modality-specific encoders.
- For scRNA-seq + bulk: scVI/totalVI latent + aggregation; align to bulk via domain adaptation.
- For omics + imaging: Perceiver IO / multimodal Transformer with modality-specific tokenizers, enabling missing-modality robustness.

3) Explicit alternatives (and why not selected):
- Early concatenation of all raw features: often brittle to scale differences and missing modalities.
- Purely linear factor models (MOFA+): strong baseline, but may underfit complex nonlinear interactions between modification patterns, expression programs, and morphology.
- Handcrafted-only imaging features: interpretable but may miss informative latent morphology; learned embeddings improve sensitivity.

4) Output to Module B:
- Provide (i) unified sample-level embedding (shared latent vector), (ii) modality-specific embeddings, and (iii) metadata masks indicating present/missing modalities; ensure consistent dimensionality and documented feature groups by modification type for later attribution (Module C).

- [B_Predictive_Model_Design] Module B: Multimodal Predictive Model for Aging/Disease Progression
  Description: Design the predictive model that consumes Module A representations and outputs cellular aging status and/or disease progression probability. Include: (1) prediction targets (binary classification, ordinal aging stages, continuous biological age, time-to-event progression) and AI tools/architectures with justification; (2) alternative modeling choices and why not selected; (3) how outputs and internal signals are structured to enable Module C attribution specifically for each RNA modification type (m6A/Ψ/m5C) and for cross-modality interactions.
  Approach: 1) Task formulation:
- If labels are stages: ordinal regression or multiclass.
- If time-to-progression: survival modeling (DeepSurv / CoxPH head on top of deep embedding) or discrete-time hazard modeling.
- If biological age is continuous: regression with calibration.

2) Preferred architecture:
- Multimodal Transformer / Mixture-of-Experts (MoE): modality-specific encoders from Module A feed a fusion module with cross-attention.
- Missing-modality handling: modality dropout during training + explicit modality masks; optionally a product-of-experts latent fusion.
- Add a structured “modification-type pathway” branch: group tokens/features by modification type (m6A vs Ψ vs m5C) so that the model learns separable contributions and supports grouped attribution.

3) Training objectives:
- Primary supervised loss (cross-entropy / ordinal / survival partial likelihood).
- Auxiliary objectives for robustness/interpretability: contrastive alignment between modalities; sparsity or group-lasso on modification-type gates; uncertainty estimation via deep ensembles.

4) Alternatives (and why not selected):
- Classical ML (RF/XGBoost) on concatenated features: strong baseline but weaker at modeling cross-modality interactions and imaging embeddings.
- Single-modality models: cannot answer the multimodal objective and may confound modification effects.
- Pure attention-only without grouped structure: can reduce clarity of per-modification attribution.

5) Outputs to Module C:
- Provide predicted probabilities (and optionally calibrated risk scores), intermediate attention/gating weights per modality and per modification-type group, and learned embeddings suitable for downstream pathway association analyses.

- [C_Interpretation_Evaluation] Module C: Interpretation, Attribution, and Evaluation with Mechanistic Links
  Description: Define how to interpret and evaluate the model, emphasizing: (1) quantitative and visual attribution of individual RNA modification types (m6A, pseudouridine, m5C) and specific sites/regions; (2) mechanistic interpretability that maps predictive features to biological pathways (telomere maintenance, DNA damage response, replication stress, chromatin regulation); (3) rigorous evaluation protocols (generalization, ablations, calibration, robustness) and how interpretation reliability is validated.
  Approach: 1) Attribution/visualization of RNA modification contributions:
- Grouped attributions: Integrated Gradients or SHAP applied to the fusion model, aggregated by modification type (m6A vs Ψ vs m5C) and by genomic region (telomeric repeats vs subtelomeric).
- Counterfactual masking: systematically mask/perturb modification-type feature groups (or specific peaks/sites) and measure delta-risk (causal-style sensitivity analysis).
- If using gating/MoE: visualize learned gates per modification type and per sample; provide cohort-level summaries (e.g., aging-high vs aging-low).

2) Cross-modality interpretability:
- Attention rollout / token attribution to connect imaging regions (foci) and omics signals.
- Modality ablation curves: performance drop when removing each modality and each modification type.

3) Mechanistic pathway linking:
- Map expression components to pathways using GSEA/GSVA (hallmarks, telomere maintenance gene sets), transcription factor activity inference (DoRothEA) or pathway activity models (PROGENy).
- Relate modification features to downstream expression programs by correlating attributed modification signals with pathway scores and telomere-factor ChIP-seq signals.
- Optional concept bottleneck model: predict intermediate biological concepts (DDR activation, replication stress, telomere dysfunction-induced foci) and then predict aging/progression, improving mechanistic interpretability.

4) Evaluation plan:
- Stratified CV with batch-aware splits; external validation if available.
- Metrics: AUROC/AUPRC, calibration (ECE, reliability curves), survival C-index/time-dependent AUC if applicable.
- Robustness: missing-modality tests, distribution shift checks, permutation tests for attribution stability.
- Biological plausibility checks: enrichment of known telomere maintenance/DDR pathways among top-attributed features.

5) Deliverables:
- A set of interpretation figures: (i) per-modification-type contribution bars, (ii) site/region heatmaps, (iii) pathway association plots, (iv) modality ablation and calibration plots.
