[Predicting Cellular Aging and Disease Progression from TERRA Modification Patterns]\n\nTERRA (Telomeric Repeat-containing RNA) plays a critical role in regulating telomere length, replication stability, and genome integrity.

      "description": "Specify how to ingest, QC, normalize, and align heterogeneous TERRA-related modalities (bulk RNA-seq, scRNA-seq, RNA modification maps from MeRIP-seq/miCLIP, ChIP-seq for telomere-associated factors, and telomere/TERRA imaging such as FISH and super-resolution morphology metrics) into a unified representation suitable for downstream prediction. Include: (1) exact data types and feature engineering choices per modality (e.g., site-level vs region-level modification features; telomere morphology descriptors vs learned embeddings), and AI tools used with scientific justification; (2) alternative integration choices and why they are not selected (e.g., early fusion vs late fusion; MOFA+ vs deep generative integration; handcrafted imaging features vs self-supervised embeddings); (3) the output interface (unified latent space and/or modality-specific embeddings with alignment) and how it will be passed to Module B.",
      "suggested_approach": "1) Preprocessing/QC per modality: \n- Bulk RNA-seq: normalization (DESeq2 size factors or TPM+log1p), batch correction (ComBat-seq) if needed.\n- scRNA-seq: scVI/totalVI for denoising + batch correction; optional cell-state summarization to sample-level via pseudo-bulk or attention pooling.\n- RNA modification maps (m6A/Ψ/m5C): call peaks/sites; convert to features such as (i) TERRA-specific modification density (per telomeric repeat unit, subtelomeric regions), (ii) peak intensity/stoichiometry proxies, (iii) motif-context features, (iv) co-occurrence patterns across modification types.\n- ChIP-seq: peaks/coverage over telomere-adjacent regions and telomere-factor loci; summarize to region-level signals.\n- Imaging (telomere FISH, TERRA RNA-FISH, STED/SIM): segment foci (Cellpose/StarDist), compute morphology metrics (count, intensity, spatial clustering, colocalization), and/or learn embeddings using a Vision Transformer (ViT) or CNN; consider self-supervised pretraining (DINOv2/MAE) to reduce label needs.\n\n2) Multimodal alignment/integration:\n- Preferred: a multimodal variational framework (multimodal VAE) or contrastive alignment (CLIP-style) to align modalities into a shared latent space while retaining modality-specific encoders.\n- For scRNA-seq + bulk: scVI/totalVI latent + aggregation; align to bulk via domain adaptation.\n- For omics + imaging: Perceiver IO / multimodal Transformer with modality-specific tokenizers, enabling missing-modality robustness.\n\n3) Explicit alternatives (and why not selected):\n- Early concatenation of all raw features: often brittle to scale differences and missing modalities.\n- Purely linear factor models (MOFA+): strong baseline, but may underfit complex nonlinear interactions between modification patterns, expression programs, and morphology.\n- Handcrafted-only imaging features: interpretable but may miss informative latent morphology; learned embeddings improve sensitivity.\n\n4) Output to Module B:\n- Provide (i) unified sample-level embedding (shared latent vector), (ii) modality-specific embeddings, and (iii) metadata masks indicating present/missing modalities; ensure consistent dimensionality and documented feature groups by modification type for later attribution (Module C).",

      "suggested_approach": "1) Attribution/visualization of RNA modification contributions:\n- Grouped attributions: Integrated Gradients or SHAP applied to the fusion model, aggregated by modification type (m6A vs Ψ vs m5C) and by genomic region (telomeric repeats vs subtelomeric).\n- Counterfactual masking: systematically mask/perturb modification-type feature groups (or specific peaks/sites) and measure delta-risk (causal-style sensitivity analysis).\n- If using gating/MoE: visualize learned gates per modification type and per sample; provide cohort-level summaries (e.g., aging-high vs aging-low).\n\n2) Cross-modality interpretability:\n- Attention rollout / token attribution to connect imaging regions (foci) and omics signals.\n- Modality ablation curves: performance drop when removing each modality and each modification type.\n\n3) Mechanistic pathway linking:\n- Map expression components to pathways using GSEA/GSVA (hallmarks, telomere maintenance gene sets), transcription factor activity inference (DoRothEA) or pathway activity models (PROGENy).\n- Relate modification features to downstream expression programs by correlating attributed modification signals with pathway scores and telomere-factor ChIP-seq signals.\n- Optional concept bottleneck model: predict intermediate biological concepts (DDR activation, replication stress, telomere dysfunction-induced foci) and then predict aging/progression, improving mechanistic interpretability.\n\n4) Evaluation plan:\n- Stratified CV with batch-aware splits; external validation if available.\n- Metrics: AUROC/AUPRC, calibration (ECE, reliability curves), survival C-index/time-dependent AUC if applicable.\n- Robustness: missing-modality tests, distribution shift checks, permutation tests for attribution stability.\n- Biological plausibility checks: enrichment of known telomere maintenance/DDR pathways among top-attributed features.\n\n5) Deliverables:\n- A set of interpretation figures: (i) per-modification-type contribution bars, (ii) site/region heatmaps, (iii) pathway association plots, (iv) modality ablation and calibration plots.",
