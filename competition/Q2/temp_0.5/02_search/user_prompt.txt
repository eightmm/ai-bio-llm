## Problem Description
Problem 2. [Predicting Cellular Aging and Disease Progression from TERRA Modification Patterns]

TERRA (Telomeric Repeat-containing RNA) plays a critical role in regulating telomere length, replication stability, and genome integrity. Emerging evidence suggests that specific RNA modification patterns—such as m6A, pseudouridine, and m5C—on TERRA molecules may serve as early molecular indicators of cellular aging and disease progression.
In this problem, you are asked to design an AI-based multimodal predictive framework that infers cellular aging status or disease progression probability from TERRA modification patterns, and explicitly visualizes the functional contribution of individual RNA modifications.

Objective
Design an integrated predictive framework that:
1.	Predicts cellular aging or disease progression probability from TERRA-related multi-omics data
2.	Quantifies and visualizes the functional contribution of individual RNA modification types
3.	Provides mechanistic interpretability linking molecular features to biological pathways

Task
You must propose a framework that includes all three modules (A–C) described below.
For each module, clearly specify:
1.	Data types and AI tools used, with scientific justification
2.	Alternative design choices and why they were not selected
3.	How the module’s outputs feed into the next stage

Module A: Multimodal Data Integration and Normalization
Integrate heterogeneous data sources related to TERRA biology into a unified representation.

Data Modalities (examples)
•	Transcriptomic data
o	Total RNA-seq
o	Single-cell RNA-seq
•	Epigenetic / RNA modification data
o	RNA modification maps (e.g., m6A, Ψ, m5C)
o	MeRIP-seq / miCLIP
o	ChIP-seq related to telomere-associated factors
•	Imaging data
o	Telomere FISH
o	TERRA RNA-FISH
o	Super-resolution imaging (STED / SIM)-derived telomere morphology metrics

Module B: Predictive Model Design
Design a model that transforms the integrated multimodal representation into aging or disease probability predictions.

Module C: Model Interpretation and Evaluation
Explain how model predictions are interpreted and evaluated. 


## Core Objective
Design an AI-based multimodal predictive framework that integrates TERRA-related multi-omics and imaging data to (i) predict cellular aging status or disease progression probability from RNA modification patterns and associated molecular/phenotypic signals, (ii) quantify and visualize the contribution of individual RNA modification types (e.g., m6A, pseudouridine, m5C), and (iii) provide mechanistic interpretability linking predictive features to biological pathways.

[List of Sub-Problems to Address]
- [A_Multimodal_Integration_Normalization] Module A: Multimodal Data Integration and Normalization for TERRA Biology
  Description: Specify how to integrate heterogeneous TERRA-related modalities (bulk RNA-seq, scRNA-seq, RNA modification maps such as m6A/Ψ/m5C from MeRIP-seq/miCLIP, telomere-factor ChIP-seq, and imaging readouts like telomere FISH/TERRA RNA-FISH/super-resolution morphology metrics) into a unified representation. Clearly describe: (1) data types to include and how each is preprocessed/normalized (batch correction, peak calling/count matrices, UMI handling, imaging feature extraction), (2) AI tools/models used for multimodal fusion with scientific justification, (3) alternative design choices and why they were not selected (e.g., late fusion vs joint latent models; linear factor models vs deep generative models), and (4) what outputs are produced (e.g., joint latent embeddings, modality-specific embeddings, uncertainty estimates, missing-modality handling) and exactly how they feed Module B.
  Approach: 1) Modality-specific preprocessing: 
- Bulk RNA-seq: standard QC, normalization (e.g., TMM/DESeq2 size factors), gene-level features; include telomere/telomere-associated gene sets and TERRA-relevant transcripts.
- scRNA-seq: scVI/scANVI for denoising + batch correction; optionally scArches for reference mapping across cohorts.
- RNA modification maps: convert MeRIP-seq/miCLIP to per-transcript/per-region modification features (peak strength, site-level probabilities, stoichiometry proxies) specifically for TERRA and telomere-proximal transcripts; normalize for coverage/GC/bias.
- ChIP-seq: compute peak counts/signals near telomeres/telomere-binding factor loci; harmonize as region-level features.
- Imaging: extract telomere/TERRA FISH phenotypes (spot counts, intensities, colocalization, spatial clustering, telomere length proxies, morphology metrics) via CellProfiler + deep segmentation (U-Net/Mask R-CNN) and/or self-supervised vision encoders (ViT/MAE) for representation learning.

2) Fusion into a unified representation:
- Preferred: deep generative multimodal latent-variable model (multimodal VAE) such as totalVI-like architectures (for count + continuous features) extended with imaging embeddings; alternatively a Multimodal Transformer with modality-specific encoders + cross-attention.
- Include explicit missing-modality robustness (modality dropout during training; product-of-experts or mixture-of-experts latent aggregation) because real cohorts rarely have all assays.

3) Justify tool selection:
- scVI-family methods are strong for scRNA-seq batch correction/latent inference; multimodal VAEs provide calibrated uncertainty and principled handling of heterogeneous distributions.
- Transformers are strong when large datasets exist and complex cross-modal interactions are expected.

4) Alternatives not selected (to be stated explicitly):
- Late fusion (train separate models then average) often loses cross-modal interactions (e.g., modification-by-expression effects) and provides weaker mechanistic coupling.
- Purely linear factor models (e.g., MOFA+) may be insufficient for nonlinear interactions between modification patterns, transcriptional programs, and imaging phenotypes; can be retained as a baseline.

5) Outputs to feed Module B:
- Joint latent embedding per sample/cell (and aggregated per individual/timepoint).
- Modality-specific embeddings + feature-level matrices for interpretability.
- Uncertainty scores and missingness masks for downstream calibrated prediction.

- [B_Predictive_Model_Design] Module B: Predictive Model Mapping Integrated TERRA Signals to Aging/Disease Risk
  Description: Design the predictive model that takes Module A outputs and produces (i) cellular aging status or biological age score and/or (ii) disease progression probability (optionally time-to-progression). Specify: (1) prediction targets and label structures (binary, ordinal stages, continuous age, survival/time-to-event), (2) the AI architecture and training objective(s), including how it uses joint vs modality-specific representations, (3) alternative model designs and why they were not selected, and (4) how the model’s intermediate outputs are structured to enable Module C interpretation (e.g., attention maps over modification types, per-feature attributions, pathway-level heads).
  Approach: 1) Targets and setups:
- Classification: senescent vs proliferative; early vs late disease stage.
- Regression: predicted biological age / aging score.
- Survival: time-to-progression using deep survival heads (e.g., DeepHit, CoxPH neural head) when longitudinal outcomes exist.
- Multi-task learning to jointly predict aging + progression; improves shared representation learning for telomere biology.

2) Recommended architecture:
- Multimodal Transformer (modality-specific encoders + cross-attention) operating on: (a) joint latent embedding from Module A, plus (b) tokens for RNA modification types (m6A/Ψ/m5C) and key genomic regions/features.
- Add a gated mixture-of-experts to explicitly model contributions from each modification type (e.g., separate experts for m6A-, Ψ-, m5C-derived features) with a learned gating network conditioned on cell state.
- For scRNA-seq: hierarchical modeling (cell-level encoder -> sample-level aggregation via attention pooling) to support patient-level predictions.

3) Training objectives and regularization:
- Primary loss: cross-entropy / MSE / negative log partial likelihood depending on task.
- Calibration: temperature scaling or Dirichlet calibration; include uncertainty from Module A.
- Modality dropout during training to enforce robustness.
- Optional monotonic constraints or ordinal regression if disease stages are ordered.

4) Alternatives not selected (explicitly):
- Single-modality models (e.g., RNA-seq only) ignore imaging and modification maps and typically reduce early-detection sensitivity.
- Classical ML (RF/SVM) on concatenated features may underperform on high-dimensional sparse inputs and offers weaker cross-modal interaction modeling.
- Pure GNN on prior networks alone may over-impose pathway structure and miss novel telomere/TERRA-specific signals; can be used as an auxiliary head.

5) Outputs to feed Module C:
- Predicted probabilities/scores with confidence intervals.
- Intermediate attention/gating weights over modification-type experts and feature groups.
- Latent representations suitable for clustering and trajectory analysis (aging continuum).

- [C_Interpretation_Evaluation] Module C: Interpretation, Mechanistic Linking, and Evaluation of the Predictive Framework
  Description: Define how to interpret model predictions with explicit quantification/visualization of the functional contribution of individual RNA modification types (m6A, pseudouridine, m5C) and how to connect predictive features to biological pathways. Specify: (1) interpretation methods at feature-, modification-type-, and pathway-level, (2) visualization outputs, (3) mechanistic interpretability strategy (hypothesis generation linking TERRA modifications to telomere maintenance/replication stress/DNA damage pathways), (4) evaluation design including metrics, baselines, ablations, robustness checks, and external validation, and (5) how insights can feed back to refine Modules A/B (iterative loop).
  Approach: 1) Attribution/interpretability methods (explicitly quantify modification-type contribution):
- Feature attribution: Integrated Gradients / DeepSHAP on the predictive head for (a) modification features, (b) expression features, (c) imaging features.
- Grouped attributions: aggregate per-feature attributions into groups by modification type (m6A vs Ψ vs m5C) and by genomic context (TERRA regions, telomere-adjacent loci).
- Model-intrinsic interpretability: use gating weights from the mixture-of-experts to report per-sample contribution of each modification type; attention rollout for Transformer cross-attention to show which features drove predictions.
- Counterfactuals: simulate perturbations (e.g., reduce m6A signal on TERRA features) to estimate causal sensitivity; use conditional generative models from Module A for realistic perturbations.

2) Mechanistic linkage to pathways:
- Map top-attributed genes/regions to pathway annotations; run enrichment (GSEA/GSVA) on the attributed gene sets and correlate with predicted risk.
- Network-based interpretation: propagate attributions over protein–protein interaction/pathway graphs to identify telomere maintenance, DNA damage response, replication stress, RNA processing, and chromatin regulation modules.
- For imaging: relate attributed morphology features to known telomere dysfunction-induced foci (TIF) phenotypes and telomere clustering/fragility signatures.

3) Visualization deliverables:
- Per-sample stacked contribution plots for m6A/Ψ/m5C (global + local explanations).
- Heatmaps of modification-site attributions along TERRA/transcript coordinates.
- Joint latent space plots colored by age/stage, with overlays of modification-type contribution.
- Pathway-level Sankey/graph views linking modification types -> genes/regions -> pathways -> predicted risk.

4) Evaluation plan:
- Metrics: AUROC/AUPRC for classification; MAE/R^2 for age regression; C-index and time-dependent AUC for survival; calibration curves/Brier score.
- Validation: train/validation/test splits stratified by batch/cohort; external cohort validation when available; patient-level leakage prevention.
- Ablations: remove each modality; remove each modification type; replace joint fusion with late fusion; linear baseline (MOFA+ + logistic/Cox) as comparator.
- Robustness: missing modality stress tests, batch shift tests, sensitivity to sequencing depth/imaging quality.

5) Feedback loop to improve Modules A/B:
- Use attribution stability diagnostics to refine feature engineering (Module A) and regularization/architecture (Module B).
- Prioritize experimentally testable hypotheses (e.g., m6A-associated regulators) based on consistent pathway-level signals.
