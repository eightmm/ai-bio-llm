      "description": "Specify how to integrate heterogeneous TERRA-related modalities (bulk RNA-seq, scRNA-seq, RNA modification maps such as m6A/Ψ/m5C from MeRIP-seq/miCLIP, telomere-factor ChIP-seq, and imaging readouts like telomere FISH/TERRA RNA-FISH/super-resolution morphology metrics) into a unified representation. Clearly describe: (1) data types to include and how each is preprocessed/normalized (batch correction, peak calling/count matrices, UMI handling, imaging feature extraction), (2) AI tools/models used for multimodal fusion with scientific justification, (3) alternative design choices and why they were not selected (e.g., late fusion vs joint latent models; linear factor models vs deep generative models), and (4) what outputs are produced (e.g., joint latent embeddings, modality-specific embeddings, uncertainty estimates, missing-modality handling) and exactly how they feed Module B.",
      "suggested_approach": "1) Modality-specific preprocessing: \n- Bulk RNA-seq: standard QC, normalization (e.g., TMM/DESeq2 size factors), gene-level features; include telomere/telomere-associated gene sets and TERRA-relevant transcripts.\n- scRNA-seq: scVI/scANVI for denoising + batch correction; optionally scArches for reference mapping across cohorts.\n- RNA modification maps: convert MeRIP-seq/miCLIP to per-transcript/per-region modification features (peak strength, site-level probabilities, stoichiometry proxies) specifically for TERRA and telomere-proximal transcripts; normalize for coverage/GC/bias.\n- ChIP-seq: compute peak counts/signals near telomeres/telomere-binding factor loci; harmonize as region-level features.\n- Imaging: extract telomere/TERRA FISH phenotypes (spot counts, intensities, colocalization, spatial clustering, telomere length proxies, morphology metrics) via CellProfiler + deep segmentation (U-Net/Mask R-CNN) and/or self-supervised vision encoders (ViT/MAE) for representation learning.\n\n2) Fusion into a unified representation:\n- Preferred: deep generative multimodal latent-variable model (multimodal VAE) such as totalVI-like architectures (for count + continuous features) extended with imaging embeddings; alternatively a Multimodal Transformer with modality-specific encoders + cross-attention.\n- Include explicit missing-modality robustness (modality dropout during training; product-of-experts or mixture-of-experts latent aggregation) because real cohorts rarely have all assays.\n\n3) Justify tool selection:\n- scVI-family methods are strong for scRNA-seq batch correction/latent inference; multimodal VAEs provide calibrated uncertainty and principled handling of heterogeneous distributions.\n- Transformers are strong when large datasets exist and complex cross-modal interactions are expected.\n\n4) Alternatives not selected (to be stated explicitly):\n- Late fusion (train separate models then average) often loses cross-modal interactions (e.g., modification-by-expression effects) and provides weaker mechanistic coupling.\n- Purely linear factor models (e.g., MOFA+) may be insufficient for nonlinear interactions between modification patterns, transcriptional programs, and imaging phenotypes; can be retained as a baseline.\n\n5) Outputs to feed Module B:\n- Joint latent embedding per sample/cell (and aggregated per individual/timepoint).\n- Modality-specific embeddings + feature-level matrices for interpretability.\n- Uncertainty scores and missingness masks for downstream calibrated prediction.",
