      "suggested_approach": "Data modeling goal: learn a shared latent space plus modality-specific factors that preserve (a) global cell state/aging signals, and (b) explicit RNA modification-type signals on TERRA.\n\n1) Modality-specific preprocessing\n- Bulk RNA-seq: standard QC, normalization (e.g., TMM/DESeq2 size factors), transform (vst/logCPM), remove confounders.\n- scRNA-seq: QC (mito %, doublets), normalization (SCTransform / scran), HVGs; integrate across batches with Harmony/scVI; optionally use scArches for reference mapping.\n- RNA modification maps (m6A/Ψ/m5C; MeRIP-seq/miCLIP): peak calling + site-level confidence; derive features per sample/cell: (i) modification burden on TERRA, (ii) per-site/region occupancy, (iii) motif/context features, (iv) enzyme expression (writers/erasers/readers) from RNA-seq as auxiliary constraints.\n- ChIP-seq (telomere-associated factors): peak quantification in relevant genomic/telomeric-adjacent regions; create factor activity scores; link peaks to genes (ABC model-style links) and to pathway scores.\n- Imaging (telomere FISH / TERRA RNA-FISH / STED/SIM metrics): extract quantitative morphology features (telomere count, intensity, co-localization, clustering, length proxies, DDR foci co-localization). Use deep feature extractors (Vision Transformer or CNN) trained with self-supervision (DINOv2-style) + classical segmentation (CellProfiler/StarDist) for robust measurements.\n\n2) Integration strategy (recommended)\n- Use a multimodal latent variable model and/or multimodal transformer:\n  - For single-cell multi-omics style integration: scVI/totalVI-like approach extended with custom ‘modification’ and ‘imaging’ encoders; learn shared latent z and modality-specific latents.\n  - For sample-level multimodal: a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) or multimodal transformer with cross-attention over modality tokens (RNA expression token set, modification token set, ChIP token set, imaging token set).\n- Missing modality handling: train with modality dropout; use product-of-experts or gated fusion so predictions remain valid when a modality is absent.\n- Batch correction: include batch covariates in latent models; adversarial domain adaptation (gradient reversal) when integrating multi-center cohorts.\n\n3) Explicit representation of RNA modification types (to enable Module C attribution)\n- Encode each modification type as a separate channel/token family (m6A, Ψ, m5C) with:\n  - Site/region embedding (telomeric repeat position bins; subtelomeric vs telomeric bins; transcript isoform context if available)\n  - Signal strength/stoichiometry embedding\n  - Confidence embedding (peak/site posterior probability)\n- Keep a “type-level summary vector” per modification to facilitate attribution and visualization later.\n\n4) Alternative designs (and why not selected)\n- Simple concatenation after per-modality PCA: easy but brittle with missing modalities, batch effects, and yields weak interpretability of modification-type contributions.\n- MOFA+ only: strong for factorization but less direct for end-to-end supervised prediction and less flexible for imaging embeddings.\n- Late fusion of separate unimodal predictors: robust but reduces ability to learn cross-modal interactions (e.g., modification × telomere morphology).\n\n5) Output handoff to Module B\n- Deliver a unified object per sample/cell: (i) shared latent embedding z_shared, (ii) modality-specific embeddings, and (iii) explicit modification-type embeddings/summaries; plus metadata (batch, donor, timepoint). Provide train/val/test splits with leakage control by donor/patient.",
