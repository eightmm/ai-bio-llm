      "suggested_approach": "1) Modality-specific preprocessing/QC: \n- Bulk RNA-seq: normalize (TPM/DESeq2 VST), remove unwanted variation (RUVSeq), adjust covariates. \n- scRNA-seq: scvi-tools (scVI) for batch-aware latent space; optionally denoise with scVI/totalVI; cell-type annotation using reference mapping. \n- RNA modifications (m6A/Ψ/m5C): build site- or peak-level features (peak intensity, occupancy, differential modification) from MeRIP-seq/miCLIP; if available, use Nanopore direct RNA modification callers; summarize to transcript-level or TERRA-locus–proximal features (e.g., per-repeat unit, subtelomeric coordinates) and include confidence scores. \n- ChIP-seq: compute peak counts/signal over telomere-adjacent regions and telomere-binding factor targets; normalize with CPM/RPGC; include QC (FRiP, NSC/RSC). \n- Imaging (telomere FISH, TERRA RNA-FISH, STED/SIM metrics): segment nuclei/telomere foci (Cellpose/U-Net), extract morphology (number of foci, intensity distributions, colocalization, telomere length proxies, spatial clustering); optionally learn embeddings with a foundation vision model (e.g., DINOv2/ViT) fine-tuned on microscopy.\n\n2) Cross-modal alignment/fusion (choose one primary): \n- Deep generative multimodal integration: scvi-tools MultiVI (for RNA+ATAC-like; adapt conceptually) or totalVI-style joint latent variable model; for broader modalities, use a multimodal variational framework (product-of-experts VAE) to obtain a shared latent embedding with modality-specific encoders. \n- If paired measurements are incomplete, use partial multimodal learning (Mixture/PoE with missing-modality training) to handle missing modalities at inference.\n\n3) Unified representation outputs for Module B: \n- Per-sample shared latent vector z_shared; modality-specific latent vectors z_mod; engineered per-modification feature blocks (m6A, Ψ, m5C) retained as separate channels for attribution; image embedding vectors; and harmonized metadata covariates (batch, cell type composition).\n\nAlternative designs (explicitly discuss): \n- Simple concatenation + ComBat/Harmony: not selected due to inability to model non-linear cross-modal relationships and missing-modality robustness. \n- MOFA+ as primary integrator: strong for omics but less direct for raw images and may underperform vs deep multimodal encoders on complex non-linear interactions; can be retained as a baseline.",

      "suggested_approach": "1) Contribution of individual modification types (global + local):\n- Modality-/channel-level ablation: retrain or re-evaluate with each modification block removed (m6A-only removed, Ψ-only removed, m5C-only removed) to quantify delta-AUROC/delta-C-index and delta-calibration; provides causal-ish evidence at the block level.\n- Attribution methods:\n  - Integrated Gradients / DeepSHAP on the multimodal model inputs (especially the modification feature tokens) to produce per-site/peak and per-type importance.\n  - Attention rollout (carefully, as supportive evidence) to visualize which modification tokens are attended to when predicting high risk.\n- Visualization:\n  - Stacked bar/violin plots of attribution mass per modification type across cohorts.\n  - Manhattan-like tracks over subtelomeric coordinates showing high-impact modified sites.\n  - Patient/sample-level “explanation cards” summarizing top features (e.g., top m6A peaks + top image morphology metrics).\n\n2) Mechanistic interpretability to pathways:\n- Map high-attribution genes/transcripts/regions to pathways using GSEA/fgsea and curated sets (Reactome/KEGG/MSigDB) and telomere-specific gene sets.\n- If RNA modification peaks map to transcripts, test enrichment for pathways related to telomere maintenance, DNA damage response, replication stress, chromatin remodeling.\n- Use mediation-style analyses: assess whether modification-type features influence prediction primarily through expression changes (e.g., two-stage models or conditional importance).\n\n3) Evaluation protocol:\n- Data splits: patient-level splits; external validation if available; time-based splits for progression.\n- Metrics: AUROC/AUPRC, accuracy/F1 (classification), C-index/IBS (survival), calibration (ECE, calibration curves), decision curve analysis.\n- Robustness: missing-modality stress tests; batch/site generalization; sensitivity to imaging batch effects.\n- Statistical testing: bootstrap CIs for metrics; permutation tests for attribution stability.\n\nAlternative choices (explicitly discuss):\n- Using only post-hoc attention as explanation: not selected because attention is not a guaranteed attribution; use IG/SHAP + ablations as primary.\n- Solely pathway overrepresentation without attribution: not selected because it can obscure which modification types drive the signal.\n\nOutputs/feedback loop:\n- Deliverables include ranked modification-type contributions, reproducible explanation plots, pathway reports, and prioritized hypotheses for wet-lab validation (e.g., perturb m6A writers/erasers and measure telomere phenotypes).
