## (A) Quantification of Exhaustion and Aging-Like Programs

### (A1) What can be quantified from the provided files (and what cannot)
**Directly available from the described inputs**
- Time-course differential expression (DE) tables for days **5, 7, 14, 21, 35, 60** (each vs a reference group), each containing per-gene:
  - `log2FoldChange`, `padj`
  - **group mean expression** (mean TPM columns for the two compared groups)

**Key limitation of the provided summary (must be explicit)**
- The transcript here does **not** include the actual DE tables themselves (gene-level rows/values). Therefore, this report can define signatures and scoring rigorously, but it **cannot print the actual computed score trajectories or per-gene log2FC/padj values** without access to those tables. All “RNA-seq–based evidence” items below are specified as *exact fields to extract* from the DE tables; they should be populated directly from the provided files.

**Consequence**
- Program scores can be computed at **timepoint (group-mean) resolution** using the `meanTPM` columns, producing one exhaustion score and one aging-like score per day.

---

### (A2) Build a genes × time matrix from mean TPM
Construct a time series matrix \(E(g,d)\) where \(g\) is gene and \(d\in\{0,5,7,14,21,35,60\}\) is day:
1. Align genes across DE tables by gene symbol/ID column.
2. For each day \(d\), take the **day-\(d\)** meanTPM column as \(E(g,d)\).
3. Take the **reference** meanTPM column as \(E(g,0)\) (verify consistency across DE tables; if multiple “day 0” vectors exist, average them and record dispersion).

Transform expression for scoring:
\[
X(g,d)=\log_2(E(g,d)+1)
\]
and standardize per gene across days:
\[
Z(g,d)=\frac{X(g,d)-\mu_g}{\sigma_g}
\]

**Minimum QC to report**
- Correlation among reconstructed \(E(g,0)\) vectors across DE tables (should be high if the same reference was used).
- Filter low-expression genes for scoring (e.g., max TPM across days > 1).

---

### (A3) Exhaustion signature and exhaustion score (data-derived)
**Goal:** derive an exhaustion program *from the time-course itself*, using early induction and persistence under chronic stimulation.

**TexSig (exhaustion signature) derivation (operational)**
Select genes satisfying:
1. **Early induction:** significant at day 5 and/or day 7 vs baseline  
   \(\text{padj}<0.05\) and \(\log_2FC>1\)
2. **Persistence:** still non-negative (or still significant) at day 14 and/or day 21  
   e.g., \(\log_2FC>0\) (optionally \(\text{padj}<0.1\) for persistence)

**Exhaustion score**
\[
\text{ExhaustionScore}(d)=\frac{1}{|TexSig|}\sum_{g\in TexSig} Z(g,d)
\]

**Required deliverables to satisfy the task**
- A table with ExhaustionScore for each day: **0, 5, 7, 14, 21, 35, 60**
- A heatmap of \(Z(g,d)\) for TexSig genes (genes clustered by temporal pattern)

---

### (A4) Aging-like signature and aging-like score (data-derived, validated against aging resources)
**Goal:** define a late-emergent, stress/aging-like program that is temporally downstream of classical exhaustion.

**AgingSig derivation (operational)**
Select genes satisfying:
1. **Late induction:** significant at day 35 and/or day 60 vs baseline  
   \(\text{padj}<0.05\) and \(\log_2FC>1\)
2. **Not early:** minimal change early (to isolate a late-onset program)  
   e.g., day 5 and day 7: \(\text{padj}>0.1\) **or** \(|\log_2FC|<0.5\)

**Aging-like score**
\[
\text{AgingLikeScore}(d)=\frac{1}{|AgingSig|}\sum_{g\in AgingSig} Z(g,d)
\]

---

### (A5) Required validation of signatures (addresses “signature derivation lacks validation”)
To ensure TexSig and AgingSig are not arbitrary:
1. **Independence / temporal separability**
   - Report overlap size \(|TexSig \cap AgingSig|\) and Jaccard index.
   - Show that TexSig genes peak earlier than AgingSig genes (e.g., median day of maximal \(Z\) differs).
2. **Aging-resource enrichment for AgingSig**
   - Compute overlap enrichment of AgingSig with **GenAge** and with **MSigDB aging/senescence gene sets** (hypergeometric test using expressed genes as background).
   - Report: overlap count, odds ratio (or enrichment ratio), and p-value/FDR.
3. **Exhaustion-biology annotation for TexSig**
   - Report whether canonical exhaustion modules (inhibitory receptors/activation-to-dysfunction TF axes) are enriched in TexSig *as an annotation check* (not as the defining criterion).

**Deliverables**
- A concise validation table:
  - \(|TexSig|, |AgingSig|, |TexSig\cap AgingSig|\)
  - GenAge/MSigDB enrichment statistics for AgingSig

---

## (B) Identification of the Critical Transition Window

### (B1) Non-circular operational definition of a “critical transition window”
Define the transition window as the earliest interval where **all** hold:
1. **Tex already established:** ExhaustionScore is high relative to baseline (e.g., exceeds its day-0 value by ≥ 1 SD).
2. **Aging-like accelerates:** AgingLikeScore shows its **largest positive increment** between adjacent sampled days.
3. **Transcriptome rewiring:** the set of significant DE genes shows a **qualitative shift** in enrichment (from exhaustion/activation modules to stress/aging/senescence/apoptosis modules), assessed by comparing enrichment outputs across adjacent timepoints.

This definition avoids assuming any specific day range in advance.

---

### (B2) How to justify a discrete transition vs gradual continuum (what must be reported)
Using the computed score trajectories:
1. **Change-point / breakpoint evidence**
   - Fit segmented regression (or compare piecewise-linear vs single-linear fits) for AgingLikeScore vs day.
   - Report: breakpoint day (restricted to the sampling grid) and model improvement (e.g., ΔAIC).
2. **Score-difference peak**
   - Compute \(\Delta \text{AgingLikeScore}(d_{i}\rightarrow d_{i+1})\) across adjacent days.
   - Define the **transition window** as the interval with maximal \(\Delta\), provided ExhaustionScore is already elevated.
3. **Functional category “appearance”**
   - For each day comparison, run the same gene-set enrichment method and report when aging/senescence/stress/apoptosis categories first become significant.

**Deliverable statement (to be filled from computed results)**
- “Critical transition window: day \(d_a\) to day \(d_b\)” (one adjacent interval is acceptable given sparse sampling).
- “Justification: breakpoint at day \(d_a\)–\(d_b\); maximal \(\Delta\) AgingLikeScore; emergence of aging/stress gene sets.”

**Sampling limitation**
- With days {0, 5, 7, 14, 21, 35, 60}, the finest resolvable window is **between adjacent sampled timepoints** (e.g., 14→21 or 21→35). Any statement finer than that is unsupported.

---

## (C) Proposal of Rejuvenation Target Genes

### (C1) Data-grounded target selection (must be applied within the transition window)
A candidate rejuvenation target must satisfy:

1. **Transition-window specificity**
   - Be significantly DE in the identified transition comparison (e.g., day 14→21 or 21→35 when represented as vs baseline in the DE tables), with \(\text{padj}<0.05\).
2. **Directional consistency with “rejuvenation”**
   - If gene expression increases with ExhaustionScore and/or AgingLikeScore → propose **inhibition**.
   - If gene expression decreases as those scores rise → propose **activation**.
3. **Program linkage**
   - The gene is either:
     - a member of TexSig or AgingSig, **or**
     - strongly correlated with one of the scores across days (e.g., Spearman |ρ| high using \(E(g,d)\)).
4. **Pathway/module coherence**
   - The gene sits in enriched modules observed in the transition window (TF circuits, stress response, apoptosis, metabolic fitness).

**Required RNA-seq evidence to present per target (populate from DE tables)**
- Expression trend: meanTPM across days (from \(E(g,d)\))
- DE statistics: \(\log_2FC\) and padj at each available day vs baseline (5,7,14,21,35,60)
- Score association: correlation sign with ExhaustionScore/AgingLikeScore (computed from time series)

> Because the DE tables are not included in this transcript, the evidence fields below are specified in a “fill-from-table” format. The final submission must include the actual numbers for the chosen targets.

### (C2) Candidate targets (mechanistically aligned; must be retained only if they meet the RNA-seq evidence criteria above)

#### (C2.1) Exhaustion-maintenance TF axis (inhibit if induced in the transition window)
1) **TOX — inhibit**  
- **RNA-seq evidence to report:** \(\log_2FC\) and padj at days 14/21/35/60 vs baseline; meanTPM trend across days; positive correlation with ExhaustionScore.  
- **Network context:** exhaustion-state maintenance TF program.  
- **Rejuvenation logic:** lowering TOX-aligned transcription should reduce Tex program intensity during the window when aging-like features begin to rise.

2) **NR4A1 / NR4A2 / NR4A3 — inhibit**  
- **RNA-seq evidence:** transition-window upregulation (stronger at 14/21/35 than 5/7), padj<0.05; positive correlation with ExhaustionScore.  
- **Context:** chronic stimulation-responsive TFs reinforcing dysfunctional adaptation.  
- **Logic:** inhibition targets a proximal transcriptional driver expected to shift expression away from TexSig-high states.

3) **PRDM1 (BLIMP-1) — inhibit**  
- **RNA-seq evidence:** induction coincident with the transition interval and persistence into later days; positive correlation with AgingLikeScore or with combined (Tex+aging) state.  
- **Context:** terminal differentiation/dysfunction-associated regulation.  
- **Logic:** reducing PRDM1-aligned commitment is expected to preserve a less terminal transcriptional profile.

4) **IRF4 and/or BATF — inhibit**  
- **RNA-seq evidence:** transition-window induction; co-variation with TexSig and late stress signatures; padj<0.05.  
- **Context:** activation-to-dysfunction transcriptional circuit.  
- **Logic:** dampening this circuit should weaken reinforcement loops that push exhausted cells toward late dysfunctional/aging-like states.

#### (C2.2) Progenitor/maintenance counter-program (activate if lost in the transition window)
5) **TCF7 — activate**  
- **RNA-seq evidence:** downregulation emerging during the transition window (negative \(\log_2FC\), padj<0.05), decreasing meanTPM with time; negative correlation with ExhaustionScore.  
- **Context:** maintenance of less-differentiated T cell programs.  
- **Logic:** restoring TCF7-associated transcription is expected to shift the bulk profile away from terminal exhaustion/aging-like trajectories.

6) **BACH2 — activate**  
- **RNA-seq evidence:** transition-window downregulation and negative correlation with exhaustion/aging scores.  
- **Context:** restraint of terminal differentiation programs.  
- **Logic:** activation counterbalances commitment toward late dysfunctional states.

#### (C2.3) Metabolic/mitochondrial fitness (activate if declining with aging-like rise)
7) **PPARGC1A (PGC-1α) — activate**  
- **RNA-seq evidence:** reduced expression during/after transition window (negative \(\log_2FC\), padj<0.05), coordinated with downregulation of mitochondrial/OXPHOS module if observed in enrichment.  
- **Context:** mitochondrial biogenesis and metabolic resilience.  
- **Logic:** improving metabolic fitness is predicted to oppose late stress/aging-like transcriptional escalation that precedes death.

8) **TFAM — activate**  
- **RNA-seq evidence:** downregulation during/after transition window; co-decline with mitochondrial maintenance signatures; negative correlation with AgingLikeScore.  
- **Context:** mitochondrial genome maintenance and function.  
- **Logic:** supports cellular integrity to reduce progression toward terminal dysfunction programs.

### (C3) How to rank and finalize targets (must be shown with dataset-derived numbers)
Finalize a ranked shortlist by:
1. Largest absolute effect size in the **transition interval** (from DE tables).
2. Strongest correlation with AgingLikeScore increase (|ρ| across days).
3. Clear module membership (TexSig/AgingSig or enriched pathway context).
4. Adequate expression (avoid low-TPM artifacts).

**Minimum target-evidence table (required)**
For each selected target gene:
- meanTPM at days 0,5,7,14,21,35,60  
- \(\log_2FC\), padj at days 5,7,14,21,35,60 vs baseline  
- Correlation with ExhaustionScore and AgingLikeScore (sign and magnitude)  
- Intervention direction (inhibit/activate) with 1–2 sentence mechanistic justification tied to the scores

---

## (D) Optional (Bonus): Therapeutic Mapping

The therapeutic mapping step requires the “provided drug–target dataset.” That dataset is not present in the transcript here; therefore, specific drug names cannot be listed without introducing unprovided information.

**If the drug–target table is available, the required output is**
- For each finalized target gene: drugs/compounds that match the direction (**inhibitor** for inhibition targets; **agonist/activator** for activation targets), including mechanism annotation present in the dataset.

**Limitations to state when reporting**
- Many TFs (e.g., TOX, PRDM1) may have limited direct small-molecule specificity in typical drug–target catalogs; mapping may return sparse hits or indirect modulators.
- Bulk RNA-seq reflects both within-cell changes and shifting cell-state composition; drug feasibility should be interpreted accordingly.

---

## Assumptions and limitations (kept explicit to avoid overstated claims)
1. **Baseline/reference identity must be verified** from DE table headers/filenames; the scoring assumes a shared day-0-like reference.
2. **Scores are group-mean (timepoint) scores** derived from meanTPM, not per-replicate distributions, unless a sample-level expression matrix is provided.
3. **Transition window resolution is limited** to adjacent sampled days; claims of finer timing are unsupported.
4. **Gene-level target claims require numeric RNA-seq evidence** (log2FC/padj/meanTPM trends). This report provides the required extraction/validation framework but cannot print those values without the DE tables.
