Problem 5. [Rejuvenation Target Discovery Along the T Cell Exhaustion–Aging–Death Axis]


Background
In the tumor microenvironment, T cells are subjected to chronic and repeated antigen stimulation over time, leading to the acquisition of a T cell exhaustion program characterized by reduced effector function and altered transcriptional states. As this process progresses, a subset of exhausted T cells is observed to exhibit stress-induced, aging-like transcriptional programs, which may ultimately culminate in cellular senescence and cell death.
In this problem, T cell exhaustion is assumed to represent a progressive trajectory toward aging-like dysfunction and terminal loss of cellular viability. Reversing this trajectory—particularly at critical transition points—can be conceptualized as a form of immune rejuvenation.
You are provided with time-course bulk RNA-seq data of T cells following tumor challenge. Using this dataset, your task is to define and analyze the exhaustion–aging–death axis and propose gene-level intervention targets capable of reversing this progression.
The following publicly available aging-related resources may be used, among others:
•	GenAge (Human Aging Genomic Resources, HAGR)
https://genomics.senescence.info/genes/
•	MSigDB Aging / Senescence Gene Sets
https://www.gsea-msigdb.org

Task Overview
Using the provided time-course T cell bulk RNA-seq data, identify candidate rejuvenation targets that could reverse T cell exhaustion and aging-like programs before terminal cell death.
Your analysis should be explicitly grounded in RNA-seq–based evidence and focused on the intersection between exhaustion and aging-like transcriptional states.
(A) Quantification of Exhaustion and Aging-Like Programs
•	Define a T cell exhaustion score and an aging-like score using transcriptional signatures derived from the time-course data.
•	Visualize and describe how these scores change over time following tumor challenge.
(B) Identification of the Critical Transition Window
•	Identify and define a key transition window along the
“Exhaustion → Aging-Like → Death” axis.
•	Justify why this time interval represents a biologically meaningful state transition, rather than a gradual continuum.
(C) Proposal of Rejuvenation Target Genes
•	Propose candidate target genes capable of reversing or disrupting the exhaustion–aging trajectory during the identified transition window.
•	For each proposed target:
o	Specify the direction of intervention: inhibition or activation
o	Provide RNA-seq–based evidence, including:
	Direction of expression change over time
	Network or pathway-level context
	Opposing regulation relative to exhaustion or aging-like signatures
Your reasoning should explicitly connect gene modulation to the expected rejuvenation-like transcriptional shift.
(D) Optional (Bonus): Therapeutic Mapping
•	Using the provided drug–target dataset, identify:
o	Existing drugs or compounds that could modulate the proposed targets
•	Briefly discuss feasibility, specificity, or limitations of these interventions

# Completed Answer
## (A) Quantification of Exhaustion and Aging-Like Programs

### A1. Inputs, data structure, and what is directly computable from the provided files
**Inputs**
- `Q5.maryphilip_metadata.csv` (10 rows): sample annotation including `day`, `condition`, `category`, `source`.
- 6 DEG tables (36,255 genes each) for timepoints **day 5, 7, 14, 21, 35, 60** (each row = gene; includes `log2FoldChange`, `padj`, and **mean TPM** columns for the two compared groups).

**Key constraint (important)**
- The DEG tables provide **meanTPM per group** (and DE statistics), not an explicit “genes × samples” expression matrix in the provided summary. Therefore, program scores can be computed robustly as **timepoint-level scores** (one value per day), and as **replicate-level scores** only if replicate-level expression is available via metadata-linked expression tables (not described in the provided analysis output).

### A2. Constructing an expression matrix across time (timepoint means)
**Goal:** build a **genes × timepoints** matrix `E(gene, day)` using the `meanTPM_*` columns.

**Procedure**
1. Use the gene key `Unnamed: 0` to align genes across all DEG files (gene IDs are unique and consistent).
2. For each DEG file (day X), extract the two mean TPM columns corresponding to the compared groups, and map them to:
   - `E(gene, day0)` (reference group in that comparison)
   - `E(gene, dayX)` (the day-X group)
3. Reconcile `E(gene, day0)` across DEG files (they should agree closely; if not, average them and record dispersion as a QC metric).

**Output**
- `E`: a timepoint-mean expression matrix for days **0, 5, 7, 14, 21, 35, 60**.

**QC metrics**
- Correlation of reconstructed `day0` meanTPM vectors across DEG files (expect high correlation if the same reference was used).
- Filter to “expressed genes” for scoring: e.g., `E(gene, any day) > 1 TPM` to avoid noise-driven signatures.

---

### A3. Defining a T cell exhaustion score from time-course-derived signatures
**Goal:** derive an exhaustion program *from this dataset* (not only from literature), then score its activity over time.

**Signature derivation (data-derived, anchored to exhaustion biology)**
1. Identify **early & sustained induction genes**:
   - Significant at early timepoints: (day 5 vs day 0) or (day 7 vs day 0): `padj < 0.05` and `log2FoldChange > 1`
   - Still induced later (day 14/21 vs day 0): e.g., `log2FoldChange > 0` (or a stricter threshold if desired)
2. From these, retain the subset enriched for canonical exhaustion-related functions by overlap with a **curated exhaustion anchor list** (used only as *annotation/validation*, not as the sole definition): inhibitory receptors and exhaustion TFs (e.g., PDCD1, HAVCR2, LAG3, TIGIT, TOX, NR4A-family, PRDM1, IRF4, BATF).  
3. The resulting set is the **Exhaustion Signature (TexSig)**.

**Scoring**
- Transform expression: `x = log2(TPM + 1)`
- Standardize per gene across timepoints: `z(gene, day)` (z-score across days)
- **Exhaustion score at each day:**  
  \[
  \text{ExhaustionScore}(day) = \frac{1}{|TexSig|} \sum_{g \in TexSig} z(g, day)
  \]
(If a downregulated exhaustion-contrasting set is also defined, use a signed score = mean(up) − mean(down).)

**Visualization**
- Line plot: `day` on x-axis; `ExhaustionScore(day)` on y-axis (one point per day).
- Optional: heatmap of `z(gene, day)` for TexSig genes, with genes clustered by temporal pattern.

**Expected time behavior to report (based on the dataset design of early vs late timepoints)**
- With tumor challenge and chronic stimulation, Tex programs typically rise **early (day 5–14)** and may plateau or further intensify through **day 21–35**, depending on whether the population shifts toward terminal exhaustion.

---

### A4. Defining an aging-like score from time-course-derived signatures (senescence/stress-like)
**Goal:** capture a secondary program that emerges later than “classical exhaustion” and reflects aging-like stress/senescence transcriptional states.

**Signature derivation (data-derived, validated with aging resources)**
1. Identify **late-induced genes**:
   - Strongly significant at later timepoints: (day 35 vs day 0) and/or (day 60 vs day 0): `padj < 0.05`, `log2FoldChange > 1`
   - Not strongly induced early: require (day 5 vs day 0) and (day 7 vs day 0) to be non-significant or small effect (e.g., `padj > 0.1` or `|log2FC| < 0.5`) to enrich for a late-onset program.
2. Validate/annotate the late-induced gene set by overlap enrichment against:
   - **GenAge** gene list(s)
   - **MSigDB aging/senescence-related sets** (including senescence/SASP-like and stress-response collections, if available)
3. The resulting set is the **Aging-like Signature (AgingSig)**.

**Scoring**
- Same approach as exhaustion: compute `z(gene, day)` across days.
- **Aging-like score at each day:**
  \[
  \text{AgingLikeScore}(day) = \frac{1}{|AgingSig|} \sum_{g \in AgingSig} z(g, day)
  \]

**Visualization**
- Line plot of `AgingLikeScore(day)` across days.
- Heatmap of AgingSig gene z-scores across time.

**How to describe the time trend (what to test and report)**
- Aging-like score should be comparatively low early and then rise later (often **after exhaustion features are established**), i.e., onset around **day 14–35** in this dataset’s temporal spacing.

## (B) Identification of the Critical Transition Window

### B1. Operational definition of the “Exhaustion → Aging-Like → Death” axis in this dataset
- **Exhaustion phase:** early induction of TexSig (days 5–14).
- **Aging-like phase:** later induction of AgingSig (typically emerging after TexSig is already elevated; candidate onset days 14–35).
- **Death/terminal loss of viability (supporting readout):** although not explicitly requested as a scored program in (A), you can corroborate the axis by additionally scoring a **Death/Apoptosis/Stress** program (e.g., apoptosis hallmark / caspase/BCL2-family–related genes) using the same framework.

### B2. Transition window identification (statistical and biological criteria)
**Candidate transition window (from the provided analysis summary):** **day 14 to day 35**.

**Why day 14–35 is treated as a biologically meaningful transition (and not just gradual drift)**
Use *multi-criterion evidence*, all computable from the DEG tables and timepoint-mean matrix:

1. **Change in slope / change-point in program scores**
   - Fit piecewise (segmented) regression of `AgingLikeScore(day)` vs `day` and test for a breakpoint.
   - A meaningful transition is supported if the best-fit model places a breakpoint between **day 14 and day 35** and improves AIC/BIC compared with a single smooth trend.

2. **Coordinated gene-set rewiring**
   - Compare DEG enrichments for:
     - day 14 vs day 0 (exhaustion establishment)
     - day 21 vs day 0 (intermediate)
     - day 35 vs day 0 (late/aging-like)
   - A discrete transition is supported when **new functional categories** (aging/senescence, stress-response, DNA damage response, apoptosis) become significantly enriched primarily in the day 21–35 comparisons rather than accumulating uniformly from day 5 onward.

3. **Temporal ordering (axis logic)**
   - Show that TexSig is already elevated by ~day 14, and AgingSig accelerates later (day 21–35).
   - Optionally, demonstrate that a death/apoptosis score increases **after** AgingSig rises, supporting the “Aging-like → Death” link.

**Deliverable statement for (B)**
- **Critical transition window:** **day 14–35**, with day 21 serving as an intermediate waypoint.
- **Interpretation:** this interval is where the transcriptome shifts from primarily exhaustion-associated regulation to a combined exhaustion + aging-like stress program that precedes terminal dysfunction.

**Limitation**
- With only 7 timepoints, breakpoint resolution is limited to the sampling grid; the true transition may occur between measured days (e.g., between 14 and 21).

## (C) Proposal of Rejuvenation Target Genes

### C1. Target-selection rules (RNA-seq grounded)
A gene is prioritized as a rejuvenation target if it satisfies **all** of the following using the provided DEG outputs:

1. **Transition-window regulation:** shows significant change specifically in **day 14/21/35** comparisons (e.g., becomes strongly DE at day 21/35 but not at day 5/7).
2. **Directionality matches “rejuvenation logic”:**
   - If a gene rises with ExhaustionScore/AgingLikeScore → propose **inhibition**.
   - If a gene drops as ExhaustionScore/AgingLikeScore rise → propose **activation**.
3. **Pathway/module coherence:** belongs to (or is a plausible regulator of) exhaustion, stress/senescence, metabolic fitness, or apoptosis pathways (supported by enrichment context from the gene sets used in A).
4. **Practical measurability in this dataset:** has sufficient expression (e.g., meanTPM > 1 in at least one timepoint) so the DE calls are not driven by low-count noise.

**Outputs to report per target (all directly retrievable from DEG tables)**
- `log2FoldChange` and `padj` at day 14, 21, 35, 60 vs baseline (as available)
- MeanTPM trend across timepoints from `E(gene, day)`
- Assignment to TexSig or AgingSig (or anti-signature)
- Brief pathway context (e.g., exhaustion TF axis; senescence/stress; apoptosis)

### C2. Candidate rejuvenation targets (to intervene during day 14–35)

> **Important note on evidence:** Below are mechanistically justified candidates aligned to the axis definition. For each, the *required RNA-seq evidence* is explicitly stated as the exact fields to extract from the provided DEG tables (log2FC/padj/meanTPM). The provided analysis summary does not include gene-level DEG results, so the directionality **must be confirmed by reading the DEG rows for these genes**.

#### (1) TOX — **Inhibition**
- **Expected RNA-seq evidence to extract**
  - Increasing meanTPM from day 14 → day 35/60 in `E(TOX, day)`
  - Positive log2FoldChange (day 21/35/60 vs day 0) with `padj < 0.05`
- **Network/pathway context**
  - Central transcriptional regulator associated with exhaustion-state maintenance.
- **Opposing regulation logic**
  - If TOX is positively aligned with TexSig and rises in the transition window, inhibiting it is predicted to **reduce ExhaustionScore** and indirectly blunt late aging-like reinforcement.

#### (2) NR4A1 / NR4A2 / NR4A3 — **Inhibition**
- **Expected RNA-seq evidence to extract**
  - Late/transition induction (becoming strongly DE at day 14–35 more than day 5–7)
  - Positive association with TexSig (e.g., co-induced with inhibitory receptor genes in the same comparisons)
- **Network/pathway context**
  - Chronic stimulation–responsive TFs that reinforce exhaustion-like transcriptional programs.
- **Opposing regulation logic**
  - Inhibition is expected to shift transcription away from TexSig-high states during the day 14–35 window.

#### (3) PRDM1 (BLIMP-1) — **Inhibition**
- **Expected RNA-seq evidence to extract**
  - Upregulated during day 14–35 with significant `padj`
  - Sustained elevation at day 35/60
- **Network/pathway context**
  - Differentiation-associated TF linked to terminal/irreversible dysfunctional trajectories in chronic stimulation settings.
- **Opposing regulation logic**
  - If PRDM1 rises with the transition into aging-like dysfunction, inhibiting it is expected to preserve a less-terminal transcriptional state (lower AgingLikeScore trajectory downstream).

#### (4) IRF4 / BATF — **Inhibition**
- **Expected RNA-seq evidence to extract**
  - Induction during transition window; co-variation with TexSig genes
- **Network/pathway context**
  - TF circuit often elevated with chronic activation and dysfunctional differentiation programs.
- **Opposing regulation logic**
  - Inhibiting this circuit (directly or indirectly) is predicted to reduce exhaustion-associated transcriptional reinforcement.

---

#### (5) TCF7 (TCF-1) — **Activation**
- **Expected RNA-seq evidence to extract**
  - Downregulation (negative log2FoldChange) emerging in day 14–35 comparisons
  - Decreasing meanTPM across day 14 → 35 → 60
- **Network/pathway context**
  - Associated with maintaining less-differentiated/progenitor-like programs; conceptually counterbalances terminal dysfunction trajectories.
- **Opposing regulation logic**
  - Activating/restoring TCF7 when it drops is predicted to move the transcriptome **away from terminal exhaustion**, lowering ExhaustionScore and indirectly limiting aging-like escalation.

#### (6) BACH2 — **Activation**
- **Expected RNA-seq evidence to extract**
  - Declines during day 14–35 with significant `padj`
- **Network/pathway context**
  - Transcriptional regulator associated with restraining terminal differentiation programs.
- **Opposing regulation logic**
  - Activation is predicted to counteract transition-window commitment toward aging-like/terminal states.

---

#### (7) PPARGC1A (PGC-1α; mitochondrial biogenesis/metabolic fitness) — **Activation**
- **Expected RNA-seq evidence to extract**
  - Decreasing meanTPM and/or significant negative log2FoldChange by day 21/35
- **Network/pathway context**
  - Links to metabolic capacity; metabolic collapse is a common co-feature of late dysfunction.
- **Opposing regulation logic**
  - If PPARGC1A drops as AgingLikeScore rises, activation is predicted to restore a more “fit” transcriptional program and blunt progression toward death-associated programs.

#### (8) TFAM (mitochondrial maintenance) — **Activation**
- **Expected RNA-seq evidence to extract**
  - Downregulation during day 14–35 (especially if a broader OXPHOS/mitochondrial set declines at the same time)
- **Network/pathway context**
  - Mitochondrial gene expression and integrity support; a plausible counter to late stress/aging-like features.
- **Opposing regulation logic**
  - Activation is expected to oppose aging-like metabolic/stress trajectories.

### C3. Practical prioritization during the transition window (day 14–35)
**Rank targets higher if:**
1. They show the **largest and most transition-specific** DE effect sizes (day 21/35 strong; day 5/7 weak).
2. They align consistently across multiple readouts:
   - TexSig/AgingSig membership
   - Program-score correlation (computed across days using `E(gene, day)` and the score trajectories)
3. They sit in coherent pathway neighborhoods:
   - TF-driven exhaustion circuitry (TOX/NR4A/PRDM1/IRF4/BATF)
   - Metabolic fitness decline (PPARGC1A/TFAM)

**Key limitation**
- Bulk timepoint means may reflect changing **cell-state composition** rather than within-cell reprogramming. This is especially relevant for “aging-like” signals, which may arise from a subpopulation expanding over time.

## (D) Optional (Bonus): Therapeutic Mapping

**Not executable from the provided materials alone.** The prompt specifies “using the provided drug–target dataset,” but the supplied analysis summary indicates that **no drug–target dataset is included** here.

### If/when a drug–target table is provided (required inputs and outputs)
**Inputs**
- Drug–target interaction table: `(drug, target_gene, mechanism)`.

**Procedure**
1. Harmonize target names to match DEG gene symbols (e.g., TOX, NR4A3, PRDM1, PPARGC1A).
2. Filter interactions by required direction:
   - For inhibition targets: keep inhibitors/antagonists/negative modulators.
   - For activation targets: keep agonists/activators/positive modulators.
3. Output a ranked list by (i) mechanism match, (ii) specificity, (iii) development stage.

**Limitations to report**
- Many TF targets (e.g., TOX, PRDM1) are often not directly druggable with high specificity; feasible interventions may require indirect pathway modulation or engineered cell therapy approaches.
- Systemic modulation risks off-target effects in other immune subsets; tumor-/T-cell–localized delivery may be necessary.

---

### Assumptions / Limitations (explicit)
1. **Reference timepoint assumption:** DEG files are assumed to compare each day X against a common baseline (likely day 0). This must be verified from filenames/column headers.
2. **MeanTPM-based scoring:** Program scores are computed at **timepoint mean** resolution unless replicate-level expression is available beyond the DEG summaries.
3. **Transition window resolution:** Day 14–35 is the best-supported window given available timepoints; finer timing cannot be inferred without denser sampling.
4. **No gene-level DEG results were provided in the summary:** all per-gene claims must be validated by extracting rows for each target gene from the DEG tables (log2FC/padj/meanTPM) using the rules specified above.
