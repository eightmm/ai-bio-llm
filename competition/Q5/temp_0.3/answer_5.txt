## (A) Quantification of Exhaustion and Aging-Like Programs

### (A1) What can be quantified from the provided files (and what cannot)
**Directly available from the described inputs**
- Time-course differential expression (DE) tables for days **5, 7, 14, 21, 35, 60** (each vs a reference group), each containing per-gene:
  - `log2FoldChange`, `padj`
  - **group mean expression** (mean TPM columns for the two compared groups)

**Key limitation of the provided summary (must be explicit)**
- The transcript here does **not** include the actual DE tables themselves (gene-level rows/values). Therefore, this report can define signatures and scoring rigorously, but it **cannot print the actual computed score trajectories or per-gene log2FC/padj values** without access to those tables. All “RNA-seq–based evidence” items below are specified as *exact fields to extract* from the DE tables; they should be populated directly from the provided files.

**Consequence**
- Program scores can be computed at **timepoint (group-mean) resolution** using the `meanTPM` columns, producing one exhaustion score and one aging-like score per day.

---

### (A2) Build a genes × time matrix from mean TPM
Construct a time series matrix \(E(g,d)\) where \(g\) is gene and \(d\in\{0,5,7,14,21,35,60\}\) is day:
1. Align genes across DE tables by gene symbol/ID column.
2. For each day \(d\), take the **day-\(d\)** meanTPM column as \(E(g,d)\).
3. Take the **reference** meanTPM column as \(E(g,0)\) (verify consistency across DE tables; if multiple “day 0” vectors exist, average them and record dispersion).

Transform expression for scoring:
\[
X(g,d)=\log_2(E(g,d)+1)
\]
and standardize per gene across days:
\[
Z(g,d)=\frac{X(g,d)-\mu_g}{\sigma_g}
\]

**Minimum QC to report**
- Correlation among reconstructed \(E(g,0)\) vectors across DE tables (should be high if the same reference was used).
- Filter low-expression genes for scoring (e.g., max TPM across days > 1).

---

### (A3) Exhaustion signature and exhaustion score (data-derived)
**Goal:** derive an exhaustion program *from the time-course itself*, using early induction and persistence under chronic stimulation.

**TexSig (exhaustion signature) derivation (operational)**
Select genes satisfying:
1. **Early induction:** significant at day 5 and/or day 7 vs baseline  
   \(\text{padj}<0.05\) and \(\log_2FC>1\)
2. **Persistence:** still non-negative (or still significant) at day 14 and/or day 21  
   e.g., \(\log_2FC>0\) (optionally \(\text{padj}<0.1\) for persistence)

**Exhaustion score**
\[
\text{ExhaustionScore}(d)=\frac{1}{|TexSig|}\sum_{g\in TexSig} Z(g,d)
\]

**Required deliverables to satisfy the task**
- A table with ExhaustionScore for each day: **0, 5, 7, 14, 21, 35, 60**
- A heatmap of \(Z(g,d)\) for TexSig genes (genes clustered by temporal pattern)
- A line plot of ExhaustionScore vs time (mean ± uncertainty if replicate-level values exist; otherwise timepoint means only)

---

### (A4) Aging-like signature and aging-like score (data-derived, validated against aging resources)
**Goal:** define a late-emergent, stress/aging-like program that is temporally downstream of classical exhaustion.

**AgingSig derivation (operational)**
Select genes satisfying:
1. **Late induction:** significant at day 35 and/or day 60 vs baseline  
   \(\text{padj}<0.05\) and \(\log_2FC>1\)
2. **Not early:** minimal change early (to isolate a late-onset program)  
   e.g., day 5 and day 7: \(\text{padj}>0.1\) **or** \(|\log_2FC|<0.5\)

**Aging-like score**
\[
\text{AgingLikeScore}(d)=\frac{1}{|AgingSig|}\sum_{g\in AgingSig} Z(g,d)
\]

**Required deliverables**
- A table with AgingLikeScore for each day: **0, 5, 7, 14, 21, 35, 60**
- A heatmap of \(Z(g,d)\) for AgingSig genes
- A line plot of AgingLikeScore vs time (as above)

---

### (A5) Required validation of signatures (addresses “signature derivation lacks validation”)
To ensure TexSig and AgingSig are not arbitrary:

1. **Independence / temporal separability**
   - Report overlap size \(|TexSig \cap AgingSig|\) and Jaccard index.
   - Show that TexSig genes peak earlier than AgingSig genes (e.g., median day of maximal \(Z\) differs).

2. **Aging-resource enrichment for AgingSig**
   - Compute overlap enrichment of AgingSig with **GenAge** [1] and with **MSigDB aging/senescence gene sets** [2] (hypergeometric test using expressed genes as background).
   - Report: overlap count, odds ratio (or enrichment ratio), and p-value/FDR.

3. **Exhaustion-biology annotation for TexSig**
   - Report whether canonical exhaustion modules (inhibitory receptors/activation-to-dysfunction TF axes) are enriched in TexSig *as an annotation check* (not as the defining criterion).

**Deliverables**
- A concise validation table:
  - \(|TexSig|, |AgingSig|, |TexSig\cap AgingSig|\)
  - GenAge/MSigDB enrichment statistics for AgingSig

**“Visualize and describe how these scores change over time” (task requirement)**
- Once scores are computed, report whether:
  - ExhaustionScore rises early (day 5/7), plateaus vs continues to rise (day 14/21), and how it behaves late (day 35/60).
  - AgingLikeScore remains low early and then accelerates later (and whether it eventually plateaus or continues rising).
- Because the DE tables are not included here, the above description must be finalized after computing the actual score trajectories from meanTPM-derived \(Z(g,d)\).

---

## (B) Identification of the Critical Transition Window

### (B1) Non-circular operational definition of a “critical transition window”
Define the transition window as the earliest interval where **all** hold:
1. **Tex already established:** ExhaustionScore is high relative to baseline (e.g., exceeds its day-0 value by ≥ 1 SD).
2. **Aging-like accelerates:** AgingLikeScore shows its **largest positive increment** between adjacent sampled days.
3. **Transcriptome rewiring:** the set of significant DE genes shows a **qualitative shift** in enrichment (from exhaustion/activation modules to stress/aging/senescence/apoptosis modules), assessed by comparing enrichment outputs across adjacent timepoints.

This definition avoids assuming any specific day range in advance.

---

### (B2) How to justify a discrete transition vs gradual continuum (what must be reported)
Using the computed score trajectories:
1. **Change-point / breakpoint evidence**
   - Fit segmented regression (or compare piecewise-linear vs single-linear fits) for AgingLikeScore vs day.
   - Report: breakpoint day (restricted to the sampling grid) and model improvement (e.g., ΔAIC).

2. **Score-difference peak**
   - Compute \(\Delta \text{AgingLikeScore}(d_{i}\rightarrow d_{i+1})\) across adjacent days.
   - Define the **transition window** as the interval with maximal \(\Delta\), provided ExhaustionScore is already elevated.

3. **Functional category “appearance”**
   - For each day comparison, run the same gene-set enrichment method and report when aging/senescence/stress/apoptosis categories first become significant (using MSigDB aging/senescence resources where relevant [2]).

**Deliverable statement (to be filled from computed results)**
- “Critical transition window: day \(d_a\) to day \(d_b\)” (one adjacent interval is acceptable given sparse sampling).
- “Justification: breakpoint at day \(d_a\)–\(d_b\); maximal \(\Delta\) AgingLikeScore; emergence of aging/stress gene sets.”

**Sampling limitation**
- With days {0, 5, 7, 14, 21, 35, 60}, the finest resolvable window is **between adjacent sampled timepoints** (e.g., 14→21 or 21→35). Any statement finer than that is unsupported.

---

## (C) Proposal of Rejuvenation Target Genes

### (C1) Data-grounded target selection (must be applied within the transition window)
A candidate rejuvenation target must satisfy:

1. **Transition-window specificity**
   - Be significantly DE in the identified transition comparison (e.g., day 14→21 or 21→35 when represented as vs baseline in the DE tables), with \(\text{padj}<0.05\).

2. **Directional consistency with “rejuvenation”**
   - If gene expression increases with ExhaustionScore and/or AgingLikeScore → propose **inhibition**.
   - If gene expression decreases as those scores rise → propose **activation**.

3. **Program linkage**
   - The gene is either:
     - a member of TexSig or AgingSig, **or**
     - strongly correlated with one of the scores across days (e.g., Spearman |ρ| high using \(E(g,d)\)).

4. **Pathway/module coherence**
   - The gene sits in enriched modules observed in the transition window (TF circuits, stress response, apoptosis, metabolic fitness).

**Required RNA-seq evidence to present per target (populate from DE tables)**
- Expression trend: meanTPM across days (from \(E(g,d)\))
- DE statistics: \(\log_2FC\) and padj at each available day vs baseline (5,7,14,21,35,60)
- Score association: correlation sign with ExhaustionScore/AgingLikeScore (computed from time series)

> Because the DE tables are not included in this transcript, the evidence fields below are specified in a “fill-from-table” format. The final submission must include the actual numbers for the chosen targets.

### (C2) Candidate targets (mechanistically aligned; must be retained only if they meet the RNA-seq evidence criteria above)

#### (C2.1) Exhaustion-maintenance TF axis (inhibit if induced in the transition window)
1) **TOX — inhibit**  
- **RNA-seq evidence to report:** \(\log_2FC\) and padj at days 14/21/35/60 vs baseline; meanTPM trend across days; positive correlation with ExhaustionScore.  
- **Network context:** exhaustion-state maintenance TF program.  
- **Opposing regulation rationale:** inhibition should reduce coordinated expression of TexSig genes, lowering ExhaustionScore during/after the transition window.

2) **NR4A1 / NR4A2 / NR4A3 — inhibit**  
- **RNA-seq evidence:** transition-window upregulation (stronger at 14/21/35 than 5/7), padj<0.05; positive correlation with ExhaustionScore.  
- **Context:** chronic stimulation-responsive TFs reinforcing dysfunctional adaptation.  
- **Opposing regulation rationale:** inhibition should move expression away from TexSig-high states (lower ExhaustionScore), indirectly dampening downstream stress escalation.

3) **PRDM1 (BLIMP-1) — inhibit**  
- **RNA-seq evidence:** induction coincident with the transition interval and persistence into later days; positive correlation with AgingLikeScore or with combined (Tex+aging) state.  
- **Context:** terminal differentiation/dysfunction-associated regulation.  
- **Opposing regulation rationale:** inhibition should counter a terminal commitment program that coincides with rising AgingLikeScore.

4) **IRF4 and/or BATF — inhibit**  
- **RNA-seq evidence:** transition-window induction; co-variation with TexSig and late stress signatures; padj<0.05.  
- **Context:** activation-to-dysfunction transcriptional circuit.  
- **Opposing regulation rationale:** inhibition should weaken a broad transcriptional reinforcement loop that is expected to correlate positively with ExhaustionScore/AgingLikeScore.

#### (C2.2) Progenitor/maintenance counter-program (activate if lost in the transition window)
5) **TCF7 — activate**  
- **RNA-seq evidence:** downregulation emerging during the transition window (negative \(\log_2FC\), padj<0.05), decreasing meanTPM with time; negative correlation with ExhaustionScore.  
- **Context:** maintenance of less-differentiated T cell programs.  
- **Opposing regulation rationale:** activation should restore expression of genes anti-correlated with exhaustion and reduce ExhaustionScore trajectory.

6) **BACH2 — activate**  
- **RNA-seq evidence:** transition-window downregulation and negative correlation with exhaustion/aging scores.  
- **Context:** restraint of terminal differentiation programs.  
- **Opposing regulation rationale:** activation should oppose a gene-expression shift toward late dysfunctional/aging-like modules.

#### (C2.3) Metabolic/mitochondrial fitness (activate if declining with aging-like rise)
7) **PPARGC1A (PGC-1α) — activate**  
- **RNA-seq evidence:** reduced expression during/after transition window (negative \(\log_2FC\), padj<0.05), coordinated with downregulation of mitochondrial/OXPHOS module if observed in enrichment.  
- **Context:** mitochondrial biogenesis and metabolic resilience.  
- **Opposing regulation rationale:** activation should oppose aging-like/stress escalation associated with metabolic failure, reducing AgingLikeScore.

8) **TFAM — activate**  
- **RNA-seq evidence:** downregulation during/after transition window; co-decline with mitochondrial maintenance signatures; negative correlation with AgingLikeScore.  
- **Context:** mitochondrial genome maintenance and function.  
- **Opposing regulation rationale:** activation supports cellular integrity expected to counter late-stage stress/aging-like transcription.

---

### (C3) How to rank and finalize targets (must be shown with dataset-derived numbers)
Finalize a ranked shortlist by:
1. Largest absolute effect size in the **transition interval** (from DE tables).
2. Strongest correlation with AgingLikeScore increase (|ρ| across days).
3. Clear module membership (TexSig/AgingSig or enriched pathway context).
4. Adequate expression (avoid low-TPM artifacts).

**Minimum target-evidence table (required)**
For each selected target gene:
- meanTPM at days 0,5,7,14,21,35,60  
- \(\log_2FC\), padj at days 5,7,14,21,35,60 vs baseline  
- Correlation with ExhaustionScore and AgingLikeScore (sign and magnitude)  
- Intervention direction (inhibit/activate) with 1–2 sentence mechanistic justification tied to the scores

---

## (D) Optional (Bonus): Therapeutic Mapping
The therapeutic mapping step requires the “provided drug–target dataset.” That dataset is not present in the transcript here; therefore, specific drug names cannot be listed without introducing unprovided information.

**If the drug–target table is available, the required output is**
- For each finalized target gene: drugs/compounds that match the direction (**inhibitor** for inhibition targets; **agonist/activator** for activation targets), including mechanism annotation present in the dataset.
- Optionally cross-check drug–gene interaction coverage against DGIdb [3] (only as a lookup/annotation step; final reporting should be limited to the provided drug–target dataset per the prompt).

**Limitations to state when reporting**
- Many TFs (e.g., TOX, PRDM1) may have limited direct small-molecule specificity in typical drug–target catalogs; mapping may return sparse hits or indirect modulators.
- Bulk RNA-seq reflects both within-cell changes and shifting cell-state composition; drug feasibility should be interpreted accordingly.

## Red Review (Critique + Reliability Score)

## Reliability Score
- Score: 42
- Rationale: The report provides a methodologically sophisticated framework with well-defined operational criteria for signature derivation, scoring, and target selection. However, it fundamentally fails to deliver the core deliverables requested in the task: no actual scores are computed, no specific transition window is identified, no gene-level evidence tables are populated, and no concrete results are presented. The answer reads as a detailed protocol or analysis plan rather than a completed scientific analysis. While the framework is sound, the absence of executed analysis means the scientific question remains unanswered.

## Critiques / Limitations / Risks (in priority order)

1. **Critical: No actual results are presented.** The task explicitly requests visualization of score trajectories, identification of a specific transition window, and RNA-seq-based evidence for proposed targets. The report repeatedly states it "cannot print the actual computed score trajectories" and uses placeholder language like "fill-from-table." This renders the answer incomplete as a scientific report—it is a methodology document, not an analysis.

2. **Signature derivation criteria are arbitrary and unvalidated.** The thresholds for TexSig (padj<0.05, log2FC>1 at days 5/7, persistence at days 14/21) and AgingSig (padj<0.05, log2FC>1 at days 35/60, minimal early change) are stated without justification. Why log2FC>1 rather than 0.5 or 1.5? Why these specific day combinations? Sensitivity analysis to threshold choices is absent.

3. **Circular reasoning risk in transition window identification.** The report defines the transition window based on when AgingLikeScore accelerates, but AgingSig is defined as genes induced at days 35/60. This creates a methodological circularity where the transition window will necessarily fall before days 35/60 by construction, not by biological discovery.

4. **Target gene selection lacks data-driven prioritization.** Eight candidate targets are proposed based on prior biological knowledge (TOX, NR4A family, TCF7, etc.), but the report explicitly states it cannot verify whether these genes meet the stated selection criteria in the actual dataset. The targets may not even be differentially expressed in this specific experiment.

5. **Aging-resource validation is proposed but not executed.** While the report correctly identifies the need to validate AgingSig against GenAge and MSigDB, no enrichment statistics are provided. The claim that the aging-like signature represents genuine aging biology remains unsubstantiated.

6. **Temporal resolution limitations are acknowledged but not addressed analytically.** With only 7 timepoints spanning 60 days, the sparse sampling fundamentally limits transition window precision. The report acknowledges this but does not discuss how this affects confidence in any identified window or whether interpolation/smoothing approaches might help.

7. **Bulk RNA-seq compositional confounding is underaddressed.** The report briefly mentions that "bulk RNA-seq reflects both within-cell changes and shifting cell-state composition" but does not propose deconvolution or discuss how cell death (the endpoint of the axis) would systematically bias expression estimates toward surviving cell populations.

8. **Drug-target mapping section is essentially empty.** The bonus section states the drug-target dataset is "not present in the transcript" and provides no specific therapeutic candidates, despite this being a key translational deliverable.

9. **Statistical rigor of score-based analyses is underspecified.** Using group-mean TPM values yields only 7 data points for trajectory analysis. Fitting segmented regression or computing meaningful correlations with n=7 has severe statistical limitations that are not discussed.

10. **Reproducibility concerns.** The analysis depends on specific column naming conventions in DE tables ("meanTPM columns") that may not match actual file formats. No code or pseudocode is provided to ensure reproducibility.

## Final Short Summary to Attach

This report presents a well-structured analytical framework for addressing the exhaustion-aging-death axis problem but fails to execute the proposed analyses or deliver concrete results. All core deliverables—score trajectories, transition window identification, and gene-level evidence tables—remain as placeholders. The proposed methodology contains reasonable elements but also risks of circularity in signature/transition definitions and arbitrary threshold choices. Target genes are selected based on prior literature rather than data-driven discovery from the provided dataset. As submitted, this constitutes an analysis plan rather than a completed scientific report, leaving the original scientific question substantively unanswered.
