## Problem Description
Problem 5. [Rejuvenation Target Discovery Along the T Cell Exhaustion–Aging–Death Axis]


Background
In the tumor microenvironment, T cells are subjected to chronic and repeated antigen stimulation over time, leading to the acquisition of a T cell exhaustion program characterized by reduced effector function and altered transcriptional states. As this process progresses, a subset of exhausted T cells is observed to exhibit stress-induced, aging-like transcriptional programs, which may ultimately culminate in cellular senescence and cell death.
In this problem, T cell exhaustion is assumed to represent a progressive trajectory toward aging-like dysfunction and terminal loss of cellular viability. Reversing this trajectory—particularly at critical transition points—can be conceptualized as a form of immune rejuvenation.
You are provided with time-course bulk RNA-seq data of T cells following tumor challenge. Using this dataset, your task is to define and analyze the exhaustion–aging–death axis and propose gene-level intervention targets capable of reversing this progression.
The following publicly available aging-related resources may be used, among others:
•	GenAge (Human Aging Genomic Resources, HAGR)
https://genomics.senescence.info/genes/
•	MSigDB Aging / Senescence Gene Sets
https://www.gsea-msigdb.org

Task Overview
Using the provided time-course T cell bulk RNA-seq data, identify candidate rejuvenation targets that could reverse T cell exhaustion and aging-like programs before terminal cell death.
Your analysis should be explicitly grounded in RNA-seq–based evidence and focused on the intersection between exhaustion and aging-like transcriptional states.
(A) Quantification of Exhaustion and Aging-Like Programs
•	Define a T cell exhaustion score and an aging-like score using transcriptional signatures derived from the time-course data.
•	Visualize and describe how these scores change over time following tumor challenge.
(B) Identification of the Critical Transition Window
•	Identify and define a key transition window along the
“Exhaustion → Aging-Like → Death” axis.
•	Justify why this time interval represents a biologically meaningful state transition, rather than a gradual continuum.
(C) Proposal of Rejuvenation Target Genes
•	Propose candidate target genes capable of reversing or disrupting the exhaustion–aging trajectory during the identified transition window.
•	For each proposed target:
o	Specify the direction of intervention: inhibition or activation
o	Provide RNA-seq–based evidence, including:
	Direction of expression change over time
	Network or pathway-level context
	Opposing regulation relative to exhaustion or aging-like signatures
Your reasoning should explicitly connect gene modulation to the expected rejuvenation-like transcriptional shift.
(D) Optional (Bonus): Therapeutic Mapping
•	Using the provided drug–target dataset, identify:
o	Existing drugs or compounds that could modulate the proposed targets
•	Briefly discuss feasibility, specificity, or limitations of these interventions





## Core Objective
Using provided time-course bulk RNA-seq of tumor-challenged T cells, define and quantify transcriptional programs representing T cell exhaustion and aging-like stress/senescence, detect a biologically meaningful transition window along an Exhaustion→Aging-like→Death trajectory, and propose gene-level intervention targets (with directionality and RNA-seq-based mechanistic evidence) that could reverse/disrupt progression toward terminal dysfunction; optionally map targets to candidate therapeutics using a provided drug–target dataset.

[List of Sub-Problems to Address]
- [A_Program_Quantification] Quantify Exhaustion and Aging-Like Programs from Time-Course Bulk RNA-seq
  Description: From the provided time-course bulk RNA-seq of T cells after tumor challenge, derive (i) a T cell exhaustion transcriptional signature/score and (ii) an aging-like (stress/senescence-like) signature/score. Ensure signatures are grounded in the dataset (data-driven derivation) and can be cross-validated/annotated with aging resources (e.g., GenAge, MSigDB aging/senescence sets). Visualize both scores over time (per-sample and aggregated by timepoint) and describe temporal dynamics (monotonicity, inflection, divergence/convergence).
  Approach: 1) RNA-seq processing/QC: normalize counts (DESeq2 VST or edgeR TMM+voom), remove low-expression genes, assess batch effects (PCA, sample correlations). 2) Time-course differential expression: use maSigPro, ImpulseDE2, or DESeq2 likelihood ratio test (full model ~ time, reduced ~ 1) to identify time-responsive genes. 3) Signature derivation (data-driven): (a) identify exhaustion-associated genes by contrasting early vs late timepoints and/or by correlating gene expression with known exhaustion marker aggregate (e.g., PDCD1/TOX/LAG3/HAVCR2) while keeping derivation primarily data-driven; (b) identify aging-like genes by enrichment overlap with MSigDB senescence/aging sets and/or GenAge, then refine to genes that are time-responsive in this dataset. 4) Scoring: compute per-sample pathway activity using GSVA/ssGSEA (bulk-appropriate) or singscore; report robustness across methods. 5) Visualization: line plots with confidence intervals, spaghetti plots per replicate, and heatmaps of leading-edge genes across time; optionally show enrichment trajectories (NES over time).

- [B_Transition_Window_Detection] Identify the Critical Transition Window Along the Exhaustion→Aging-Like→Death Axis
  Description: Using the exhaustion and aging-like scores (and optionally additional viability/death-associated expression programs inferred from RNA-seq), detect a key transition window along the proposed trajectory. Define the time interval and justify why it represents a discrete state transition (e.g., change-point, switch-like module reconfiguration) rather than a gradual continuum. Provide quantitative evidence supporting the transition window selection.
  Approach: 1) Change-point/inflexion detection on scores: apply segmented regression (piecewise linear), change-point methods (e.g., ruptures in Python), or Bayesian change-point models to exhaustion and aging-like score time series; test for statistically supported breakpoints. 2) Multi-program integration: compute a composite axis score (e.g., exhaustion + aging-like − survival/effector) and repeat change-point detection. 3) Module/state switching evidence: build co-expression modules with WGCNA across all samples; identify modules whose eigengenes switch dominance across time; quantify module preservation pre vs post window. 4) “Not gradual” justification: show (a) abrupt slope change, (b) increased variance/heterogeneity near transition, (c) discrete gain/loss of enriched pathways (GSEA leading-edge turnover) between adjacent timepoints, and/or (d) sharp emergence of death/senescence markers (e.g., DNA damage response, SASP-like cytokines, apoptotic pathways) in the identified window.

- [C_Rejuvenation_Target_Genes] Propose Gene-Level Rejuvenation Targets Active in the Transition Window
  Description: Propose candidate intervention target genes that could reverse/disrupt progression from exhaustion into aging-like dysfunction during the identified transition window. For each target, specify intervention direction (inhibition vs activation) and provide RNA-seq-grounded evidence: (i) expression directionality over time (especially across the transition window), (ii) network/pathway context (module membership, upstream regulator evidence, pathway enrichment), and (iii) opposing regulation relative to exhaustion and/or aging-like signatures (e.g., negative correlation with rejuvenation/effector programs and positive correlation with exhaustion/aging-like scores, or vice versa). Explicitly connect target modulation to an expected rejuvenation-like transcriptional shift.
  Approach: 1) Candidate extraction focused on the transition window: identify genes with maximal differential change across pre-window vs window vs post-window (ANOVA/time-contrast), and genes whose expression change precedes the rise in aging-like score (lag correlation). 2) Prioritize regulators over markers: infer key drivers via (a) WGCNA hub genes in transition-associated modules, (b) TF activity inference using DoRothEA+VIPER (bulk-compatible) or decoupleR, (c) dynamic network inference (e.g., GENIE3/GRNBoost2) restricted to time-responsive genes. 3) Evidence assembly per target: provide plots of expression vs time, correlation with exhaustion/aging scores, module/pathway annotations, and whether target sits upstream of multiple signature genes (regulon enrichment). 4) Direction of intervention: propose inhibition for genes increasing with exhaustion/aging-like programs and predicted to drive them; propose activation for genes decreasing with exhaustion/aging-like programs and associated with effector/memory maintenance, DNA repair homeostasis, mitochondrial fitness, or anti-senescence states. 5) Sanity checks: ensure targets are not merely reflecting changing cell composition (bulk deconvolution with CIBERSORTx or MuSiC reference if available; otherwise marker-based checks) and evaluate confounding by proliferation/cell cycle signatures. 6) Output format: ranked list of targets with a concise ‘evidence card’ per gene (time-course change, score associations, network context, mechanistic rationale, predicted effect on signatures).

- [D_Therapeutic_Mapping_Bonus] Map Proposed Targets to Existing Drugs/Compounds (Optional Bonus)
  Description: Using the provided drug–target dataset, map the proposed rejuvenation targets to existing drugs/compounds. For each matched compound, report target coverage, directionality compatibility (agonist/antagonist vs activation/inhibition need), and briefly discuss feasibility, specificity, and limitations (e.g., pleiotropy, immune toxicity, delivery to T cells, on-target/off-target risks).
  Approach: 1) Standardize identifiers: harmonize gene symbols/UniProt IDs between target list and drug–target dataset; handle aliases. 2) Directionality matching: filter/rank compounds by mechanism-of-action alignment (inhibitor vs activator/agonist) and by selectivity metrics if available. 3) Prioritization: rank by (a) number of rejuvenation targets hit (polypharmacology) vs (b) specificity for a single high-confidence driver, (c) known immunomodulatory liabilities. 4) Reporting: produce a table (Target, Desired direction, Drug, MoA, Evidence/notes, Limitations) and a short narrative on translational constraints (systemic exposure, T-cell intrinsic targeting, tumor effects).
