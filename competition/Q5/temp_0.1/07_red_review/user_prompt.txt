# Problem
Problem 5. [Rejuvenation Target Discovery Along the T Cell Exhaustion–Aging–Death Axis]


Background
In the tumor microenvironment, T cells are subjected to chronic and repeated antigen stimulation over time, leading to the acquisition of a T cell exhaustion program characterized by reduced effector function and altered transcriptional states. As this process progresses, a subset of exhausted T cells is observed to exhibit stress-induced, aging-like transcriptional programs, which may ultimately culminate in cellular senescence and cell death.
In this problem, T cell exhaustion is assumed to represent a progressive trajectory toward aging-like dysfunction and terminal loss of cellular viability. Reversing this trajectory—particularly at critical transition points—can be conceptualized as a form of immune rejuvenation.
You are provided with time-course bulk RNA-seq data of T cells following tumor challenge. Using this dataset, your task is to define and analyze the exhaustion–aging–death axis and propose gene-level intervention targets capable of reversing this progression.
The following publicly available aging-related resources may be used, among others:
•	GenAge (Human Aging Genomic Resources, HAGR)
https://genomics.senescence.info/genes/
•	MSigDB Aging / Senescence Gene Sets
https://www.gsea-msigdb.org

Task Overview
Using the provided time-course T cell bulk RNA-seq data, identify candidate rejuvenation targets that could reverse T cell exhaustion and aging-like programs before terminal cell death.
Your analysis should be explicitly grounded in RNA-seq–based evidence and focused on the intersection between exhaustion and aging-like transcriptional states.
(A) Quantification of Exhaustion and Aging-Like Programs
•	Define a T cell exhaustion score and an aging-like score using transcriptional signatures derived from the time-course data.
•	Visualize and describe how these scores change over time following tumor challenge.
(B) Identification of the Critical Transition Window
•	Identify and define a key transition window along the
“Exhaustion → Aging-Like → Death” axis.
•	Justify why this time interval represents a biologically meaningful state transition, rather than a gradual continuum.
(C) Proposal of Rejuvenation Target Genes
•	Propose candidate target genes capable of reversing or disrupting the exhaustion–aging trajectory during the identified transition window.
•	For each proposed target:
o	Specify the direction of intervention: inhibition or activation
o	Provide RNA-seq–based evidence, including:
	Direction of expression change over time
	Network or pathway-level context
	Opposing regulation relative to exhaustion or aging-like signatures
Your reasoning should explicitly connect gene modulation to the expected rejuvenation-like transcriptional shift.
(D) Optional (Bonus): Therapeutic Mapping
•	Using the provided drug–target dataset, identify:
o	Existing drugs or compounds that could modulate the proposed targets
•	Briefly discuss feasibility, specificity, or limitations of these interventions

# Completed Answer
## Problem 5. Rejuvenation Target Discovery Along the T Cell Exhaustion–Aging–Death Axis (Revised Report)

### Data availability note (scope/limitations)
The prompt refers to “provided time-course bulk RNA-seq data,” but no DEG CSVs (or sample-level expression matrix) were included in this chat. Therefore, **I cannot truthfully report computed numeric scores, log2FC/padj values, enrichment outputs, or confirmed target behaviors here**. To satisfy the task requirements **without fabricating results**, this report (i) defines *fully executable* scoring/transition/target-selection procedures that operate directly on the described DEG summary tables and (ii) specifies the **exact evidence tables/plots** that must be produced from those files to complete the analysis.

---

# (A) Quantification of Exhaustion and Aging-Like Programs

## (A.1) Inputs and standardized preprocessing (reproducible)
**Inputs (as described):**
- Metadata: `Q5.maryphilip_metadata.csv` (days/conditions)
- DEG summary tables containing per-gene `log2FoldChange`, `padj`, and `meanTPM_*`:
  - Early (L vs E): `L5 vs E5`, `L7 vs E7`
  - Within-L time progression: `L14 vs L7`, `L21 vs L14`, `L35 vs L14`, `L60 vs L14`

**Preprocessing (deterministic):**
1. **Gene identifier harmonization:** unify `gene_name` / `Unnamed: 0` to a single column `gene`.
2. **Expression filter (to reduce unstable fold-changes):** keep genes with  
   \[
   \max(\text{meanTPM across columns in that file}) \ge 1
   \]
3. **Padj floor for scoring:** define `padj_eff = max(padj, 1e-300)` to avoid infinities.

**Why this matters:** without sample-level matrices, program scoring must be contrast-based; the filter and padj floor reduce domination by low-abundance noise.

---

## (A.2) Exhaustion program score (data-derived, validated against canonical biology)
### (A.2.1) Construct a **dataset-derived exhaustion signature**
**Primary (data-driven) rule:**
- `ExhaustionUp` = genes **up in both** early exhaustion contrasts:
  - in `L5 vs E5`: `padj < 0.05` and `log2FoldChange > 0`
  - in `L7 vs E7`: `padj < 0.05` and `log2FoldChange > 0`
  - take the **intersection** of these two sets

**Required validation (addresses “signature not validated” critique):**
From the same DEG tables, compute and report:
1. **Canonical marker overlap rate** with a pre-specified list (presence + direction), e.g.  
   `PDCD1, LAG3, HAVCR2, TIGIT, CTLA4, TOX, PRDM1, EOMES, NR4A1/2/3`  
   - Report: which are present in the tables; which meet `padj < 0.05`; their log2FC signs at Day5/Day7.
2. **Directional concordance:** fraction of canonical markers with `log2FC > 0` in Day5 and Day7.
3. **Enrichment sanity check (contrast-level):** run a pre-ranked gene set enrichment on `L7 vs E7` using a known exhaustion gene set *only as a check*, not as the definition. (This does not add new data; it is a validation layer.)

### (A.2.2) Compute an exhaustion score per contrast (robust to outliers)
To avoid the methodological pitfall of “mean log2FC dominated by a few genes,” compute a **signed, significance-weighted score**:

For each gene in a contrast, define:
\[
S_g = \operatorname{sign}(\text{log2FC}_g)\cdot(-\log_{10}(\text{padj\_eff}_g))
\]

Then, for each contrast \(c\):
\[
\textbf{ExhaustionScore}(c)=\operatorname{median}_{g\in ExhaustionUp}(S_{g,c})
\]
(using median or 20% trimmed mean; median recommended for robustness)

**Output required:** a table listing ExhaustionScore for each available contrast.

---

## (A.3) Aging-like program score (explicitly separated from generic stress/apoptosis)
A key critique is that “aging-like” can collapse into generic stress. To address this, aging-like scoring is defined as a **two-stage** procedure:

### (A.3.1) Candidate aging universe (allowed external resources)
- `AgingDB` = union of genes from:
  - GenAge (human)
  - MSigDB aging/senescence-related sets (aging-up/down, senescence, SASP, DNA damage–linked senescence)

### (A.3.2) Dataset anchoring to late-emerging dysfunction (not early exhaustion)
Define late-emergent genes using within-L contrasts:
- `LateUp(c)` for \(c \in\{L21\!:\!L14,\ L35\!:\!L14,\ L60\!:\!L14\}\): genes with `padj < 0.05` and `log2FoldChange > 0`

Define:
- `AgingLikeUp = (LateUp(L21 vs L14) ∪ LateUp(L35 vs L14) ∪ LateUp(L60 vs L14)) ∩ AgingDB`

**Specificity filter (reduces “generic stress” capture):**
- Remove genes that are already strongly induced in early exhaustion:
  - exclude any gene with `padj < 0.05` and `log2FC > 0` in `L7 vs E7`
This ensures the “aging-like” set reflects **late acquisition** rather than the initial exhaustion program.

### (A.3.3) Compute an aging-like score per contrast (same robust statistic)
For each contrast \(c\):
\[
\textbf{AgingLikeScore}(c)=\operatorname{median}_{g\in AgingLikeUp}(S_{g,c})
\]

**Required outputs:**
- AgingLikeScore per contrast
- The size of `AgingLikeUp` and how many were removed by the early-exhaustion exclusion filter

---

## (A.4) “Death” (terminal loss of viability) transcriptional proxy score (axis-completing, still RNA-seq–based)
Because viability is not measured, define a *transcriptional death proxy*:

- `DeathUp` = genes in apoptosis/cell-death pathways (MSigDB apoptosis/cell death sets) that are significantly up (`padj < 0.05`, `log2FC > 0`) in **late** contrasts (at least one of L35/L60 vs L14), optionally requiring presence of canonical death regulators (e.g., FAS axis, caspases, pro-apoptotic BCL2-family) **if they appear in the DEG tables**.

Score:
\[
\textbf{DeathScore}(c)=\operatorname{median}_{g\in DeathUp}(S_{g,c})
\]

---

## (A.5) Visualization and description (what must be shown)
**Minimum plots:**
1. Line plot across contrasts for **ExhaustionScore**, **AgingLikeScore**, **DeathScore**
2. Scatter: ExhaustionScore vs AgingLikeScore (each point = contrast)
3. Heatmap of top contributing genes (top |S|) within each signature across contrasts

**Minimum descriptive outputs (must be grounded in computed values):**
- Identify when ExhaustionScore first becomes positive/high (typically early L vs E)
- Identify when AgingLikeScore first becomes positive/high (late within-L contrasts)
- Identify when DeathScore sharply increases (terminal phase proxy)

---

# (B) Identification of the Critical Transition Window

## (B.1) Transition window definition (non-circular, data-driven)
A “critical transition window” is defined as the **earliest interval** where:
1. **AgingLikeScore increases abruptly** relative to the preceding timepoint/contrast, and
2. **DeathScore begins to rise** (or becomes significantly positive), and
3. ExhaustionScore remains elevated (i.e., not reverting to baseline)

Because contrasts are not uniform (early L vs E; late L vs L14), define candidate transition boundaries that are actually testable:
- Boundary 1: Day7→Day14 (via `L14 vs L7`)
- Boundary 2: Day14→Day21 (via `L21 vs L14`)
- Boundary 3: Day21→Day35 (approx. using `L35 vs L14` together with `L21 vs L14`; see below)

## (B.2) Quantitative criteria to declare a “window” (vs continuum)
Compute the following from the score table:

1. **Score jump (change-point proxy):**
   \[
   \Delta_{14\to 21} = \text{AgingLikeScore}(L21\!:\!L14) - \text{AgingLikeScore}(L14\!:\!L7)
   \]
   and analogs for other adjacent windows where definable. The transition window is supported if one interval shows the **largest positive jump** for AgingLikeScore and a concurrent positive jump in DeathScore.

2. **Leading-edge turnover (module composition shift):**
   - For each late contrast, take top N upregulated genes by \(S_g\) (or by padj then log2FC).
   - Compute Jaccard overlap between Day21 and Day35 leading-edge sets.
   - A transition is supported if Day21 introduces a **distinct leading-edge** (lower overlap) enriched for senescence/DNA-damage/death proxies compared to earlier contrasts.

3. **Specific emergence of aging-like (not generic stress):**
   - Report what fraction of Day21 upregulated genes overlap AgingDB **after** applying the early-exhaustion exclusion filter.
   - A transition is supported if this fraction increases sharply at Day21 compared to Day14.

**Interpretation constraint (addresses overstatement risk):**
- Even if these criteria are met, bulk contrasts cannot distinguish **within-cell state change** from **shifts in subpopulation composition**. Thus, this window is a *transcriptional-state transition* in bulk, not definitive evidence of per-cell senescence/death.

---

# (C) Proposal of Rejuvenation Target Genes (during the transition window)

## (C.1) Target nomination rules (must be satisfied using the DEG tables)
A candidate rejuvenation target must satisfy **all** of:

1. **Temporal alignment with the transition window**
   - For an “inhibit” target: significantly up at the transition (`padj < 0.05`, `log2FC > 0` in `L21 vs L14`), and not merely an early marker (fails early-exhaustion exclusion if claiming “aging-like driver”).
   - For an “activate” target: significantly down at the transition (`padj < 0.05`, `log2FC < 0` in `L21 vs L14`) and remains suppressed later.

2. **Program coupling**
   - The gene’s \(S_g\) must correlate with the relevant score across contrasts (e.g., positive with AgingLikeScore for inhibitors; negative with it for activators). With only a few contrasts, report Spearman correlation qualitatively (sign, not overinterpreting p-values).

3. **Pathway/module context from the same DEG data**
   - Assign the gene to a module using one of:
     - membership in `ExhaustionUp`, `AgingLikeUp`, or `DeathUp`, and/or
     - co-variation of log2FC vector across contrasts with module eigengene proxy (e.g., correlation with median log2FC of the signature genes per contrast).
   - Report which module(s) it tracks.

**Required deliverable per gene (RNA-seq evidence card):**
- `log2FoldChange` and `padj` for: `L7 vs E7`, `L14 vs L7`, `L21 vs L14`, `L35 vs L14`, `L60 vs L14`
- Whether it is in ExhaustionUp / AgingLikeUp / DeathUp
- Direction of intervention (inhibit/activate) and which score it is expected to reduce (Exhaustion vs AgingLike vs Death proxy)

---

## (C.2) Candidate target classes and example genes (to be confirmed in your DEG tables)
Because I do not have the DEG tables here, the genes below are presented as **mechanistically justified candidates** that must be **retained only if they pass (C.1)** in this dataset. This avoids the prior report’s unsupported “hypothetical” target claims.

### (C.2.1) Exhaustion-lock transcriptional regulators (likely “INHIBIT” if induced)
- **TOX (INHIBIT)** — retain only if: up in early exhaustion (`L7 vs E7`) and remains high at/after transition (`L21 vs L14`), tracking ExhaustionScore and/or AgingLikeScore.  
  **Expected rejuvenation shift if inhibited:** reduction in exhaustion-module expression (lower ExhaustionScore), enabling recovery of progenitor/fitness programs *if they are observed to be suppressed*.
- **NR4A1/NR4A2/NR4A3 (INHIBIT; family member(s) chosen by data)** — retain only if: sustained or re-induced expression at transition, correlating with ExhaustionScore and with decline of fitness markers.  
  **Expected shift:** dampened chronic-stimulation transcriptional imprinting, lowering exhaustion signature intensity.

### (C.2.2) Late dysfunction / aging-like stress nodes (prefer “INHIBIT” if specifically late-induced)
To address “aging-like vs generic stress,” retain only if genes are:
- in `AgingLikeUp` **and**
- not significantly induced in early exhaustion (`L7 vs E7`)

Examples to test:
- **HIF1A or glycolysis control nodes such as PFKFB3 / SLC2A1 / LDHA (INHIBIT; choose the strongest late-induced node)**  
  **Evidence required:** coordinated late induction beginning at transition; positive tracking with AgingLikeScore.  
  **Expected shift:** reduce late stress-metabolic program, lowering AgingLikeScore and potentially DeathScore proxy if death programs are metabolically coupled in the data.

### (C.2.3) Mitochondrial/fitness maintenance factors (likely “ACTIVATE” if suppressed late)
- **TFAM (ACTIVATE/RESTORE)** — retain only if: significantly down at transition and/or later, negatively correlated with AgingLikeScore and/or DeathScore.  
  **Expected shift:** restoration of mitochondrial gene expression programs (if those are down), improving a “fitness” proxy and opposing the aging-like trajectory.

### (C.2.4) Senescence/death axis markers (avoid direct targeting; use as readouts)
- **CDKN1A/p21 (generally NOT a direct rejuvenation target here)**  
  **Use:** confirm whether senescence-like arrest appears at transition (a component of the axis definition).  
  **Rationale:** direct inhibition may be unsafe/ill-posed; in this framework it is a *marker/readout* for upstream stress reduction rather than a primary intervention.

---

## (C.3) How each intervention is expected to reverse the axis (explicit signature logic)
For any retained target gene \(g\):

- If **INHIBIT** and \(g\) is late-induced and aligned with AgingLikeScore, then inhibiting \(g\) is expected to:
  - decrease \(S_g\) and reduce the median \(S\) across `AgingLikeUp` (lower AgingLikeScore),
  - and, if \(g\) also lies in `DeathUp`, reduce DeathScore proxy.

- If **ACTIVATE** and \(g\) is late-suppressed (negative log2FC), then activation is expected to:
  - restore expression of fitness-associated genes (detected as reduced suppression in within-L contrasts),
  - indirectly reduce AgingLikeScore/DeathScore if those programs are antagonistic in the DEG structure.

**Required in the final write-up (once DEG tables are loaded):**
Include a short table per target showing its time-contrast trajectory and which score(s) it explains (via correlation sign and module membership).

---

# (D) Optional (Bonus): Therapeutic Mapping

## (D.1) Feasibility with current inputs
A drug–target dataset was not provided in this chat; therefore, I cannot list compounds without introducing unprovided external data.

## (D.2) What to output once the drug–target table is available
For each retained target from (C), join by gene symbol (or standardized IDs) and report:
- Compound name
- Mechanism (inhibitor/agonist)
- Target specificity notes (single-target vs polypharmacology, if annotated)
- Direction match to intervention (must match INHIBIT vs ACTIVATE)

**General limitation (must be stated even after mapping):**
- Many top candidates are transcription factors (e.g., TOX, NR4A family), which often lack direct small-molecule modulators; feasibility may favor pathway-level or ex vivo engineering strategies.

---

## Summary of required final deliverables (to fully satisfy the assignment once DEG CSVs are loaded)
1. **Scores table + plots**: ExhaustionScore, AgingLikeScore, DeathScore across all contrasts.
2. **Signature validation**: canonical exhaustion marker presence/direction and at least one enrichment sanity check.
3. **Transition window call**: based on observed score jumps + leading-edge turnover + aging-specific emergence (not baseline-structure arguments).
4. **Target evidence cards**: for each retained gene, explicit log2FC/padj across contrasts + module membership + intervention direction and expected score change.
5. **Optional drug mapping**: only if the drug–target dataset is supplied.

This revised structure removes unsupported claims, eliminates circular reasoning, strengthens aging-like specificity relative to generic stress, and provides a reproducible, RNA-seq–grounded path to concrete targets and a defensible transition window.
