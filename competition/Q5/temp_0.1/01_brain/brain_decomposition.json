  "original_problem_text": "Problem 5. [Rejuvenation Target Discovery Along the T Cell Exhaustion–Aging–Death Axis]\n\n\nBackground\nIn the tumor microenvironment, T cells are subjected to chronic and repeated antigen stimulation over time, leading to the acquisition of a T cell exhaustion program characterized by reduced effector function and altered transcriptional states. As this process progresses, a subset of exhausted T cells is observed to exhibit stress-induced, aging-like transcriptional programs, which may ultimately culminate in cellular senescence and cell death.\nIn this problem, T cell exhaustion is assumed to represent a progressive trajectory toward aging-like dysfunction and terminal loss of cellular viability. Reversing this trajectory—particularly at critical transition points—can be conceptualized as a form of immune rejuvenation.\nYou are provided with time-course bulk RNA-seq data of T cells following tumor challenge. Using this dataset, your task is to define and analyze the exhaustion–aging–death axis and propose gene-level intervention targets capable of reversing this progression.\nThe following publicly available aging-related resources may be used, among others:\n•\tGenAge (Human Aging Genomic Resources, HAGR)\nhttps://genomics.senescence.info/genes/\n•\tMSigDB Aging / Senescence Gene Sets\nhttps://www.gsea-msigdb.org\n\nTask Overview\nUsing the provided time-course T cell bulk RNA-seq data, identify candidate rejuvenation targets that could reverse T cell exhaustion and aging-like programs before terminal cell death.\nYour analysis should be explicitly grounded in RNA-seq–based evidence and focused on the intersection between exhaustion and aging-like transcriptional states.\n(A) Quantification of Exhaustion and Aging-Like Programs\n•\tDefine a T cell exhaustion score and an aging-like score using transcriptional signatures derived from the time-course data.\n•\tVisualize and describe how these scores change over time following tumor challenge.\n(B) Identification of the Critical Transition Window\n•\tIdentify and define a key transition window along the\n“Exhaustion → Aging-Like → Death” axis.\n•\tJustify why this time interval represents a biologically meaningful state transition, rather than a gradual continuum.\n(C) Proposal of Rejuvenation Target Genes\n•\tPropose candidate target genes capable of reversing or disrupting the exhaustion–aging trajectory during the identified transition window.\n•\tFor each proposed target:\no\tSpecify the direction of intervention: inhibition or activation\no\tProvide RNA-seq–based evidence, including:\n\tDirection of expression change over time\n\tNetwork or pathway-level context\n\tOpposing regulation relative to exhaustion or aging-like signatures\nYour reasoning should explicitly connect gene modulation to the expected rejuvenation-like transcriptional shift.\n(D) Optional (Bonus): Therapeutic Mapping\n•\tUsing the provided drug–target dataset, identify:\no\tExisting drugs or compounds that could modulate the proposed targets\n•\tBriefly discuss feasibility, specificity, or limitations of these interventions\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "From the provided time-course bulk RNA-seq of T cells after tumor challenge, derive (i) a T cell exhaustion transcriptional signature/score and (ii) an aging-like (stress/senescence-like) signature/score. Ensure signatures are grounded in the dataset (data-driven derivation) and can be cross-validated/annotated with aging resources (e.g., GenAge, MSigDB aging/senescence sets). Visualize both scores over time (per-sample and aggregated by timepoint) and describe temporal dynamics (monotonicity, inflection, divergence/convergence).",
      "suggested_approach": "1) RNA-seq processing/QC: normalize counts (DESeq2 VST or edgeR TMM+voom), remove low-expression genes, assess batch effects (PCA, sample correlations). 2) Time-course differential expression: use maSigPro, ImpulseDE2, or DESeq2 likelihood ratio test (full model ~ time, reduced ~ 1) to identify time-responsive genes. 3) Signature derivation (data-driven): (a) identify exhaustion-associated genes by contrasting early vs late timepoints and/or by correlating gene expression with known exhaustion marker aggregate (e.g., PDCD1/TOX/LAG3/HAVCR2) while keeping derivation primarily data-driven; (b) identify aging-like genes by enrichment overlap with MSigDB senescence/aging sets and/or GenAge, then refine to genes that are time-responsive in this dataset. 4) Scoring: compute per-sample pathway activity using GSVA/ssGSEA (bulk-appropriate) or singscore; report robustness across methods. 5) Visualization: line plots with confidence intervals, spaghetti plots per replicate, and heatmaps of leading-edge genes across time; optionally show enrichment trajectories (NES over time).",

Define the time interval and justify why it represents a discrete state transition (e.g., change-point, switch-like module reconfiguration) rather than a gradual continuum. Provide quantitative evidence supporting the transition window selection.",
      "suggested_approach": "1) Change-point/inflexion detection on scores: apply segmented regression (piecewise linear), change-point methods (e.g., ruptures in Python), or Bayesian change-point models to exhaustion and aging-like score time series; test for statistically supported breakpoints. 2) Multi-program integration: compute a composite axis score (e.g., exhaustion + aging-like − survival/effector) and repeat change-point detection. 3) Module/state switching evidence: build co-expression modules with WGCNA across all samples; identify modules whose eigengenes switch dominance across time; quantify module preservation pre vs post window. 4) “Not gradual” justification: show (a) abrupt slope change, (b) increased variance/heterogeneity near transition, (c) discrete gain/loss of enriched pathways (GSEA leading-edge turnover) between adjacent timepoints, and/or (d) sharp emergence of death/senescence markers (e.g., DNA damage response, SASP-like cytokines, apoptotic pathways) in the identified window.",

For each target, specify intervention direction (inhibition vs activation) and provide RNA-seq-grounded evidence: (i) expression directionality over time (especially across the transition window), (ii) network/pathway context (module membership, upstream regulator evidence, pathway enrichment), and (iii) opposing regulation relative to exhaustion and/or aging-like signatures (e.g., negative correlation with rejuvenation/effector programs and positive correlation with exhaustion/aging-like scores, or vice versa). Explicitly connect target modulation to an expected rejuvenation-like transcriptional shift.",
      "suggested_approach": "1) Candidate extraction focused on the transition window: identify genes with maximal differential change across pre-window vs window vs post-window (ANOVA/time-contrast), and genes whose expression change precedes the rise in aging-like score (lag correlation). 2) Prioritize regulators over markers: infer key drivers via (a) WGCNA hub genes in transition-associated modules, (b) TF activity inference using DoRothEA+VIPER (bulk-compatible) or decoupleR, (c) dynamic network inference (e.g., GENIE3/GRNBoost2) restricted to time-responsive genes. 3) Evidence assembly per target: provide plots of expression vs time, correlation with exhaustion/aging scores, module/pathway annotations, and whether target sits upstream of multiple signature genes (regulon enrichment). 4) Direction of intervention: propose inhibition for genes increasing with exhaustion/aging-like programs and predicted to drive them; propose activation for genes decreasing with exhaustion/aging-like programs and associated with effector/memory maintenance, DNA repair homeostasis, mitochondrial fitness, or anti-senescence states. 5) Sanity checks: ensure targets are not merely reflecting changing cell composition (bulk deconvolution with CIBERSORTx or MuSiC reference if available; otherwise marker-based checks) and evaluate confounding by proliferation/cell cycle signatures. 6) Output format: ranked list of targets with a concise ‘evidence card’ per gene (time-course change, score associations, network context, mechanistic rationale, predicted effect on signatures).",
