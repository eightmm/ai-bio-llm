## Problem 5. Rejuvenation Target Discovery Along the T Cell Exhaustion–Aging–Death Axis (Time‑course bulk RNA‑seq)

### Global limitation (applies to A–D)
The required inputs to execute the analysis—(i) a **gene × sample RNA‑seq expression matrix**, (ii) **sample metadata containing timepoints/replicates**, and (iii) the **drug–target mapping table**—were not available in the provided materials used to generate the original output (only a manifest-like text file was ingested). Therefore, **no dataset-grounded exhaustion/aging scores, trajectories, transition window, DE results, module memberships, or drug mappings can be reported here** without introducing unprovided data (not permitted).

What follows is a **submission-ready, fully specified analysis and reporting plan** that preserves the required A–D structure and explicitly defines (1) how exhaustion/aging-like programs will be quantified from the time-course RNA‑seq, (2) how a critical transition window will be identified and justified as a state shift, and (3) how gene-level rejuvenation targets will be nominated with RNA‑seq–based evidence once the missing inputs are provided.

## (A) Quantification of Exhaustion and Aging‑Like Programs

### (A.1) Inputs and preprocessing (required to make all downstream outputs RNA‑seq–grounded)
**Required inputs**
- Expression matrix: raw counts preferred (genes × samples).
- Metadata table: `sample_id`, `time_post_tumor_challenge`, `replicate`, and `batch` (if any).
- (Optional but recommended) QC metrics: library size, mapping rate, rRNA fraction.

**Normalization (counts)**
- Filter: retain genes with CPM > 1 in ≥ 20–30% of samples (exact cutoff pre-specified).
- Normalize: TMM (edgeR) or DESeq2 size factors.
- Transform for scoring: log2-CPM with prior count (e.g., +0.5) or DESeq2 VST.

**Confounding/heterogeneity checks (bulk-specific)**
- Plot expression of canonical T cell markers (e.g., CD3D/E), CD8 markers if relevant, and proliferation markers to detect major composition shifts.
- If composition changes are suspected, report this as a limitation and (if feasible with available marker sets) include a sensitivity analysis stratifying by inferred composition proxies (still within bulk constraints).

---

### (A.2) Exhaustion score definition (RNA‑seq–derived, with anti-circularity safeguards)
**Goal:** quantify an exhaustion program that rises with chronic stimulation.

**A.2.1 Discovery of a time-course exhaustion module (data-derived)**
- Fit a time-course model per gene (e.g., spline regression or impulse model) using normalized expression.
- Identify genes significantly associated with time (FDR < 0.05) and cluster them by temporal pattern (e.g., k-means on fitted trajectories or hierarchical clustering).
- Select the cluster(s) that show **early induction and sustained elevation** as the *exhaustion-up discovery module*.

**A.2.2 Anchor marker validation (not used to define the score)**
To avoid tautology/confirmation bias, canonical exhaustion markers (e.g., **PDCD1, LAG3, HAVCR2, TIGIT, ENTPD1, TOX, NR4A1/2/3**) are used **only for external validation**:
- Report whether anchors are enriched in the exhaustion-up discovery module (Fisher’s exact test; FDR < 0.05).
- Report correlation of module eigengene with anchor expression (Spearman ρ; pre-specify |ρ| ≥ 0.3 as “moderate”).

**A.2.3 Exhaustion score computation**
Compute per-sample score using **ssGSEA/GSVA** or a standardized mean:
- `ExhaustionScore = ssGSEA(Exhaustion_Up_DiscoveryModule) − ssGSEA(Effector_Up_Module)`
where `Effector_Up_Module` is the empirically derived cluster showing **decline** in effector genes over time (validated by enrichment for cytotoxic/effector markers).

**Reporting requirement (once data are available)**
- Provide the final gene lists used for both components.
- Provide per-sample ExhaustionScore values and summary statistics per timepoint.

---

### (A.3) Aging‑like score definition (resource-informed, but dataset-validated)
**Goal:** quantify emergence of stress/aging-like transcriptional programs downstream of chronic exhaustion.

**A.3.1 Aging-like discovery module (data-derived)**
- From time-associated genes (FDR < 0.05), select clusters that show **late activation** (low early, rising in later timepoints).
- Validate “aging-like” interpretation by enrichment against aging/senescence resources (allowed by the prompt):
  - MSigDB aging/senescence gene sets and/or GenAge lists.
  - Require enrichment significance (FDR < 0.05) for at least one aging/senescence-related set.

**A.3.2 Anti-circularity safeguard**
- Do **not** define the aging-like score directly from GenAge/MSigDB lists alone.
- Use those resources only as **orthogonal validation** of the late-activation module.

**A.3.3 Aging-like score computation**
- `AgingLikeScore = ssGSEA(AgingLike_LateDiscoveryModule) − ssGSEA(MetabolicFitness_Module)`
where `MetabolicFitness_Module` is a dataset-derived cluster that declines late and is enriched for mitochondrial function/protein translation/energy metabolism terms (enrichment reported).

**Reporting requirement (once data are available)**
- Provide the discovery module gene lists.
- Provide per-sample AgingLikeScore values and summary statistics per timepoint.

---

### (A.4) Visualization and description of score dynamics over time (deliverables)
Once expression and metadata are available, generate:
1. **Time-course plots** of ExhaustionScore and AgingLikeScore:
   - Mean ± 95% CI per timepoint (CI via bootstrap over replicates).
   - Overlay replicate-level points.
2. **Heatmap** of signature genes ordered by temporal peak (early exhaustion vs late aging-like).
3. **Correlation plot**: ExhaustionScore vs AgingLikeScore colored by time.

**Minimum descriptive statistics to report**
- Monotonicity test (Spearman correlation of score with time).
- Effect size: Δscore between early baseline and peak/late timepoint.
- Whether AgingLikeScore rise lags ExhaustionScore rise (tested via cross-correlation or lead–lag regression; pre-specify the decision rule).

## (B) Identification of the Critical Transition Window

### (B.1) Operational definition of the “Exhaustion → Aging‑Like → Death” axis
In this bulk time-course, define three phases based on program dynamics:
- **Exhaustion phase:** ExhaustionScore increases significantly with time while AgingLikeScore remains low/flat.
- **Transition phase (critical window):** AgingLikeScore shows a **statistically supported change in slope** (acceleration) while ExhaustionScore **plateaus or changes slope**, indicating a qualitative program switch rather than uniform drift.
- **Late phase:** AgingLikeScore remains high and a **death/apoptosis program** increases.

### (B.2) Primary criterion: change-point (breakpoint) detection on scores
**Method**
- Fit segmented (piecewise linear) regression of each score vs time (or generalized additive model with explicit change-point testing).
- Identify breakpoint(s) for AgingLikeScore: `T1` with 95% CI.
- Define `T2` as the earliest time where either:
  - a death/apoptosis score begins sustained increase (see B.3), or
  - AgingLikeScore slope returns toward zero (stabilization).

**Pre-specified thresholds (for reproducibility)**
- Model comparison improvement: ΔAIC ≥ 10 (or likelihood ratio test FDR < 0.05 across tested breakpoints).
- Minimum slope change: |Δslope| ≥ 0.5 SD(score) per unit time (exact unit defined by metadata).

**Deliverable (required by the task)**
- The transition window reported as `[T1, T2]` in dataset time units **cannot be instantiated here** due to missing metadata/scores, but the above rule set is the exact criterion that will produce it once data are available.

### (B.3) Independent corroboration that the window is a “state transition” (not a smooth continuum)
At least **two** of the following must agree with `[T1, T2]`:

1. **Module switching**
   - WGCNA (or correlation network) on normalized expression.
   - Report eigengene trajectories: exhaustion module saturates while aging-like module rises sharply near `T1`.

2. **Epoch-based differential expression**
   - Define epochs: Pre (<T1), Window (T1–T2), Post (>T2).
   - Test DE: Pre vs Window and Window vs Post (FDR < 0.05; |log2FC| ≥ 0.5).
   - Require that stress/senescence/apoptosis pathways are specifically enriched in Window/Post contrasts.

3. **Death/apoptosis program score**
   - Compute ssGSEA using a standard apoptosis/death gene set (from MSigDB Hallmark Apoptosis or an internally derived death-up module).
   - Require DeathScore to increase significantly after or during `[T1, T2]` (segmented regression FDR < 0.05).

### (B.4) Alternative structures and falsification tests (assumption control)
Because the axis may not be strictly linear in bulk data:
- Test whether a **single** breakpoint model fits better than no-breakpoint; if not, report “no discrete transition detectable.”
- Test whether aging-like activation occurs **in parallel** with exhaustion (no lag). If parallel, interpret the “axis” as coupled programs rather than sequential commitment, and adjust target timing accordingly.

## (C) Proposal of Rejuvenation Target Genes

### (C.1) Target nomination framework (ensures RNA‑seq–based evidence at the transition)
Targets must be nominated **from this dataset** using all criteria below once expression data are available:

1. **Window-linked change**
   - Significant change in expression in Pre→Window and/or Window→Post (FDR < 0.05; |log2FC| ≥ 0.5).

2. **Program coupling**
   - Correlation with ExhaustionScore and/or AgingLikeScore across samples (Spearman |ρ| ≥ 0.3; FDR < 0.05).
   - For inhibition targets: positive correlation with dysfunction scores.
   - For activation targets: negative correlation with dysfunction scores and/or positive correlation with metabolic/effector modules.

3. **Network centrality**
   - High module membership (e.g., WGCNA kME in the top 10% of its module) in the exhaustion or aging-like module for inhibition targets, or in the metabolic fitness module for activation targets.

4. **Directionality consistent with “rejuvenation-like shift”**
   - Inhibition targets: genes rising into the transition window that help consolidate exhaustion/aging-like programs.
   - Activation targets: genes decreasing into the transition window that support mitochondrial fitness/effector competence/repair.

**Required per-target reporting table (once data are available)**
- `Gene`, `Intervention (Inhibit/Activate)`,
- `log2FC Pre→Window`, `FDR`, `log2FC Window→Post`, `FDR`,
- `Corr with ExhaustionScore (ρ, FDR)`, `Corr with AgingLikeScore (ρ, FDR)`,
- `Module (label)`, `kME/module membership`,
- `Brief pathway context` (from enrichment of the module).

### (C.2) Candidate gene targets (biologically plausible priors; must be validated by the dataset)
Because the RNA-seq matrix is missing, the items below are **prior candidates** commonly associated with exhaustion and stress/aging-like programs. They are included to satisfy the task’s requirement to *propose* gene-level interventions, but **they are not claimed to be supported by the provided dataset**. Each candidate includes the **exact RNA‑seq evidence that must be shown** to accept it.

#### (C.2.1) TOX — **inhibition**
- **Intervention direction:** inhibit.
- **Expected RNA-seq evidence to report (must come from this dataset):**
  - TOX increases early and remains high through the transition and late phases; significant Pre→Window induction (FDR < 0.05).
  - Positive correlation with ExhaustionScore; membership/centrality in the exhaustion module.
  - Co-expression with inhibitory receptor module genes during/after the transition window.
- **Rejuvenation rationale (transcriptional shift expected):**
  - Reducing TOX-associated regulatory coherence should lower exhaustion module activity and permit partial recovery of effector/metabolic modules if performed before/within `[T1, T2]`.

#### (C.2.2) NR4A1 / NR4A2 / NR4A3 — **inhibition (family-level)**
- **Intervention direction:** inhibit NR4A activity (redundancy-aware).
- **Expected RNA-seq evidence:**
  - Sustained elevation with time and significant positive correlation with ExhaustionScore; ideally increased coupling to AgingLikeScore during the transition.
  - Placement in an early-to-mid exhaustion regulatory module.
- **Rejuvenation rationale:**
  - Dampening chronic-stimulation transcriptional enforcement is expected to shift global expression away from exhaustion maintenance programs during the transition window.

#### (C.2.3) CDKN1A (p21) — **inhibition (timing-restricted)**
- **Intervention direction:** inhibit, **restricted to `[T1, T2]`** if the dataset supports a senescence-like checkpoint activation.
- **Expected RNA-seq evidence:**
  - Low early expression with sharp activation at/after `T1` (significant Pre→Window increase).
  - Strong positive correlation with AgingLikeScore; membership in the late aging-like/stress module.
- **Rejuvenation rationale:**
  - If the transition reflects commitment to a growth-arrest/stress program, reducing p21 induction during `[T1, T2]` should oppose the aging-like score and support viability/proliferation-associated transcriptional programs.
- **Required limitation statement (must be included in the final analysis):**
  - Checkpoint interference is context-sensitive; interpretation must remain limited to transcriptomic association unless additional functional data are provided.

#### (C.2.4) PINK1 / PRKN (Parkin) mitophagy axis — **activation**
- **Intervention direction:** activate mitochondrial quality control.
- **Expected RNA-seq evidence:**
  - Decline of PINK1/PRKN (or a broader mitophagy/autophagy module) into the transition/late phase, with negative correlation to AgingLikeScore and/or DeathScore.
  - Membership in the metabolic fitness module that drops around `[T1, T2]`.
- **Rejuvenation rationale:**
  - Enhancing mitochondrial maintenance should oppose stress/aging-like transcriptional programs and reduce progression toward death-associated signatures.

#### (C.2.5) SIRT1 — **activation**
- **Intervention direction:** activate.
- **Expected RNA-seq evidence:**
  - Decrease of SIRT1 expression and/or its co-expression module into the transition/late phase, inversely tracking AgingLikeScore.
  - Within-timepoint stratification: SIRT1-high samples show lower aging-like/stress enrichment (supports association beyond time alone).
- **Rejuvenation rationale:**
  - Promoting stress-resistance/metabolic competence is expected to counter aging-like program induction and improve the transcriptional “fitness” state.

## (D) Optional (Bonus): Therapeutic Mapping (Drug–Target Dataset)

### Limitation
A drug–target mapping dataset was not available in the provided materials used to generate the original output; therefore, no compound mapping can be executed or reported here without introducing unprovided data.

### Required mapping output once the table is available (actionable specification)
**Procedure**
1. Harmonize identifiers (gene symbols/Ensembl; handle aliases).
2. For each validated target from (C), retrieve compounds matching intervention direction:
   - Inhibition targets → inhibitors/antagonists.
   - Activation targets → agonists/activators (or pathway-level activators, clearly labeled indirect).
3. Report feasibility constraints:
   - Direct druggability (e.g., TFs often lack direct small-molecule inhibitors).
   - Specificity and off-target concerns.
   - Whether mechanism matches required timing (transition-window targeting).

**Deliverable**
- Table: `TargetGene → Compound → MoA → Direction match (Y/N) → Notes/limitations`.
