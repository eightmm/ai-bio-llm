Problem 5. [Rejuvenation Target Discovery Along the T Cell Exhaustion–Aging–Death Axis]


Background
In the tumor microenvironment, T cells are subjected to chronic and repeated antigen stimulation over time, leading to the acquisition of a T cell exhaustion program characterized by reduced effector function and altered transcriptional states. As this process progresses, a subset of exhausted T cells is observed to exhibit stress-induced, aging-like transcriptional programs, which may ultimately culminate in cellular senescence and cell death.
In this problem, T cell exhaustion is assumed to represent a progressive trajectory toward aging-like dysfunction and terminal loss of cellular viability. Reversing this trajectory—particularly at critical transition points—can be conceptualized as a form of immune rejuvenation.

# Comprehensive Framework for Rejuvenation Target Discovery Along the T Cell Exhaustion–Aging–Death Axis: A Literature-Grounded Analysis

The progressive loss of T cell function in the tumor microenvironment represents one of the most critical barriers to effective immunotherapy. Recent discoveries have revealed that T cell exhaustion—characterized by reduced proliferative capacity, impaired cytotoxic function, and sustained expression of inhibitory receptors—shares unexpected transcriptional and mechanistic similarities with cellular aging and senescence. This report synthesizes current knowledge from the immunology, gerontology, and computational biology literature to provide a structured framework for identifying and validating rejuvenation targets that can interrupt the trajectory from exhaustion through aging-like dysfunction toward terminal cell death. By anchoring our analysis in time-course transcriptomic evidence and leveraging established aging-related gene resources, we present a systematic approach to nominate intervention genes with clear mechanistic directionality and therapeutic potential.

## Molecular Architecture of T Cell Exhaustion as a Degenerative Axis

### Defining the Exhaustion-Aging-Death Continuum in T Cells

T cell exhaustion in the tumor microenvironment is not a static endpoint but rather a progressive developmental program that shares striking parallels with cellular senescence and aging-related dysfunction[1][12]. Single-cell RNA-sequencing studies have revealed that CD8+ T cells undergoing chronic antigen stimulation develop into phenotypically and functionally distinct subpopulations, including progenitor exhausted T cells (Tpex), intermediate exhausted T cells, and terminally exhausted T cells (Texterm)[22][40]. The most severe exhaustion phenotype is characterized by markedly elevated expression of multiple inhibitory receptors—including PD-1, LAG-3, TIM-3, and TIGIT—substantially reduced production of effector cytokines, and profoundly impaired proliferative capacity[4][12].

Importantly, recent evidence demonstrates that this exhaustion program overlaps substantially with cellular senescence pathways. Exhausted T cells from both tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte populations and chronically infected tissues express elevated p16INK4a, accumulate DNA damage, and activate p38MAPK signaling—hallmark features of cell cycle arrest and senescence[46]. This connection between exhaustion and senescence is not merely correlative; mechanistic studies show that targeting senescence-associated pathways in exhausted T cells can restore proliferative capacity and effector function, suggesting that senescence drives at least a component of the exhausted phenotype[46]. Furthermore, metabolic dysfunction—including impaired mitochondrial respiration, reduced glycolysis, and elevated endoplasmic reticulum stress—characterizes both exhausted and senescent T cells, contributing to energy insufficiency and cell death[21].

The continuum from exhaustion toward death appears mediated by cumulative stress: persistent antigen stimulation drives sustained T cell receptor signaling through NFAT, which initiates both exhaustion programs and DNA damage responses[9][12]. As the process progresses, accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial fragmentation, epigenetic remodeling, and activation of apoptotic pathways push T cells toward terminal dysfunction and viability loss[21][24]. This progression offers multiple intervention windows—each representing a distinct transcriptional state transition where reversal may still be possible.

### Transcriptional Regulators Governing the Exhaustion-Aging Axis

A small number of transcription factors have emerged as master regulators that orchestrate the exhaustion-aging-like program in CD8+ T cells. The thymocyte selection-associated HMG box (TOX) transcription factor stands out as perhaps the most critical driver, with expression remaining persistently elevated throughout exhaustion and correlating strongly with the severity of T cell dysfunction[12][38][55]. TOX operates through chromatin remodeling to establish an exhaustion-linked epigenetic landscape, directly promoting continuous expression of inhibitory receptors such as PD-1 and suppressing effector genes[12][55]. Downstream of TCR signaling, NFAT homodimers accumulate and drive expression of TOX, NR4A family members (NR4A1, NR4A2, NR4A3), and other exhaustion-associated transcription factors[9][12][20][55].

The NR4A family represents a second critical node, with these orphan nuclear receptors functioning as immediate early genes rapidly induced by sustained TCR stimulation[20][23]. NR4A1 and NR4A3 directly bind the promoter regions of exhaustion-associated genes including PDCD1 (PD-1), LAG3, and HAVCR2 (TIM-3), propagating the exhaustion program[20]. Early manipulation of NR4A3 during T cell differentiation shifts outcomes toward memory precursor and central memory cells while enhancing cytokine production[23], suggesting that NR4A family inhibition during the transition window could redirect T cells away from exhaustion.

In contrast, TCF-1 (encoded by TCF7), a high mobility group box transcription factor, maintains stem-like qualities in T cells and is highly expressed in progenitor exhausted populations[19][22][59]. TCF-1 expression is directly antagonized by inflammatory signals and terminal exhaustion-inducing factors; its downregulation is associated with irreversible loss of self-renewal capacity[22][59]. EOMES and BLIMP-1, while elevated in terminally exhausted cells, are expressed at lower levels in stem-like and memory T cells, suggesting that their suppression during transitions could preserve proliferative potential[41][55].

The balance between NFAT and activator protein 1 (AP-1) complex members dictates the developmental outcome, with chronic TCR stimulation driving an imbalance toward partnerless NFAT that propagates exhaustion while suppressing AP-1-driven effector function[55]. This suggests that interventions restoring AP-1 activity or antagonizing NFAT-driven programs represent a rational approach during the transition window.

## Framework for Quantifying Exhaustion and Aging-Like Programs from Time-Course RNA-seq

### Preprocessing and Quality Control for Time-Course Transcriptomics

Proper analysis of time-course bulk RNA-seq data requires rigorous preprocessing and quality control tailored to the temporal structure of the experiment[8][11][39]. Initial quality assessment should quantify read distribution across samples, identify potential outliers based on principal component analysis or density plots, and verify library size differences that may reflect biological or technical variation. For count normalization, size-factor-based approaches (as implemented in DESeq2 using median-of-ratios normalization or TMM normalization in edgeR) are recommended because they properly account for compositional biases inherent in RNA-seq data and provide a foundation for downstream statistical modeling[8].

Importantly, the time-course design requires explicit modeling of temporal correlation structure. Unlike simple case-control comparisons, adjacent timepoints in a time-course series exhibit autocorrelation—expression levels at time t are probabilistically dependent on those at time t-1. Standard methods that treat all samples as independent may substantially overestimate statistical significance and generate false discoveries. Mixed-effects models that account for repeated measures structure (treating timepoint as a continuous or categorical factor and accounting for the nesting of replicates within timepoints) provide appropriate inference[39]. Alternatively, variance-stabilizing transformations (vst in DESeq2 or limma-voom for precision weights in linear modeling) followed by mixed-model or autoregressive approaches ensure that temporal dependencies are properly propagated through statistical tests[39].

### Construction of the Exhaustion Signature from Time-Course Data

Rather than hard-coding a priori exhaustion genes (a approach that risks confirmation bias), the exhaustion signature should be inductively derived from the time-course data itself, validated against established resources. Time-course-specific differential expression tools such as ImpulseDE2, maSigPro, or Trendy can identify genes exhibiting monotonic increase or showing specific temporal patterns (e.g., rise followed by plateau) consistent with the exhaustion trajectory[8][11][14]. ImpulseDE2 is particularly suited to this task, as it fits an impulse model (constant → intermediate → constant) that can capture genes transitioning from a baseline to an exhausted state and maintaining that elevated expression through later timepoints.

The resulting gene set should be validated by enrichment analysis against exhaustion-specific resources and curated gene lists. Exhaustion-associated genes annotated in the literature include canonical inhibitory receptors (*PDCD1*, *LAG3*, *HAVCR2*, *TIGIT*), dysfunction-associated markers (*CD39*, *CD101*, *ENTPD1*), and transcriptional regulators (*TOX*, *NR4A* family members, *BATF*, *IRF4*). Importantly, genes showing antagonistic patterns—such as *TCF7*, effector cytokine genes (*IFNG*, *TNF*), and granzyme genes (*GZMB*, *GZMK*)—should show *decreased* expression over the time course in exhaustion[1][4].

Gene ontology and pathway enrichment analysis (using fgsea for pre-ranked gene lists derived from time-course comparisons) should reveal that the increasing exhaustion-associated gene set is enriched for immune checkpoint signaling, chronic TCR stimulation responses, and epigenetic remodeling[1][4]. The decreasing component should be depleted for effector cytokine signaling and enhanced for chromatin-state genes linked to transcriptional silencing[1][4]. This bidirectional validation ensures that the signature captures genuine molecular transitions rather than noise or confounding batch effects.

### Construction of the Aging-Like Signature

The aging-like or senescence-related signature should similarly be grounded in observed temporal patterns, then validated against established aging resources. Human Aging Genomic Resources (HAGR) GenAge database provides a curated compendium of over 300 human aging-associated genes, while meta-analyses of aging transcriptomics in the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) define hallmark aging signatures[3][6][7][10]. A gene set termed DEMAGALHAES_AGING_UP comprises 56 genes consistently overexpressed across aging, with the most significant being *APOD* (apolipoprotein D)[7][10]. These genes are enriched for inflammation, immune responses, and lysosomal function[7][10]. Conversely, DEMAGALHAES_AGING_DOWN contains 17 genes consistently underexpressed, prominently including collagen genes (*COL1A1*, *COL3A1*, *COL4A5*) and genes linked to energy metabolism and mitochondrial function[7].

Applied to tumor-challenged T cells, an aging-like signature in T cells would be expected to emerge *later* in the time course than exhaustion markers, reflecting cumulative stress. The signature should include senescence-associated genes such as p16INK4a (CDKN2A), p21CIP1 (CDKN1A), and pro-inflammatory cytokines that constitute the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) including *IL6*, *TNF*, and *IL1A*[15][18][46]. Additionally, stress-response genes related to p53 activation, DNA damage responses (e.g., GADD45 family), and mitochondrial dysfunction should be elevated[46]. Genes linked to energy metabolism, particularly those involved in oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial biogenesis (e.g., PGC1A, TFAM, NDUFS family members), should show *decreasing* patterns consistent with metabolic insufficiency[21].

A critical distinction between exhaustion and aging-like signatures is their timing: exhaustion emerges early with repeated antigen stimulation, while aging-like transcriptional shifts should become prominent only as cells accumulate stress and enter the transition window. This temporal staggering provides a means to distinguish the two processes in time-course data.

### Computational Scoring and Trajectory Analysis

Once gene signatures are defined, per-sample signature scores should be computed using rank-based methods such as GSVA (Gene Set Variation Analysis) or ssGSEA (single-sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis), which are robust to the statistical properties of RNA-seq data and provide cell-wise interpretability[25][28][29]. These methods rank genes within each sample and compute an enrichment score reflecting whether signature genes occupy the top or bottom of the ranked list, providing a sample-specific, gene-set-level quantitative metric independent of absolute expression scales[25][28]. An alternative approach, computationally simpler but less statistically principled, involves computing z-scored mean expression of genes in each directional component (up-regulated and down-regulated separately) to avoid cancellation of opposing signals; this approach may be more intuitive for visualization but provides less principled statistical inference[28].

Trajectories of exhaustion and aging-like scores over time should be visualized as line plots with individual replicates shown as thin lines and mean ± confidence interval (or LOESS curve with 95% CI) overlaid. The expected pattern is that exhaustion score begins low at baseline, rises steeply in early timepoints, and plateaus or continues at high levels through later timepoints. The aging-like score should remain relatively low initially, remain depressed through mid-timepoints, then show a sharp increase during the transition window and continuing rise in late timepoints toward death.

To quantify temporal trends, time should be modeled as a continuous variable in a linear mixed-effects model with score as the outcome, fixed effect of time, and random intercept per replicate (or per biological subject if applicable). The coefficient on time and its 95% confidence interval quantifies the rate of score change per unit time. Additionally, segmented regression (fitting piecewise linear functions with breakpoints) can test whether score trajectories show different slopes in different time intervals, which would indicate state transitions[14].

## Identifying the Critical Transition Window

### Change-Point Detection and Segmentation Analysis

The transition from an exhaustion-dominant state toward an aging-like-dominant state with proximal cell death should manifest as a discrete inflection point or transition window in the time-course trajectories, rather than gradual monotonic change throughout. Multiple complementary approaches can identify such transitions. Segmented regression, implemented via tools like Trendy or conceptually via FPOP (Functional Pruned Optimal Partitioning) algorithms, fits piecewise linear models with optimized breakpoints[14][17]. The Bayesian Information Criterion selects the optimal number of segments; multiple breakpoints can indicate successive state transitions (e.g., exhaustion onset → aging-like acceleration → death acceleration).

Changepoint detection frameworks, such as PELT (Pruned Exact Linear Time) or dynamic programming approaches, can be applied directly to the exhaustion and aging-like score vectors. These methods identify the timepoint(s) at which the mean or variance of the signal changes most significantly. If the exhaustion score shows one plateau and the aging-like score shows a sharp rise at a specific window, the intersection of these inflection points defines the critical transition window[14].

### Multivariate Transcriptomic State Clustering

Beyond single-signature analysis, the global transcriptomic state should be characterized using unsupervised dimensionality reduction. Principal component analysis (PCA) or UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) on normalized, batch-corrected expression data will reveal whether samples naturally cluster by timepoint or biological state. Early timepoints should cluster together, mid timepoints should occupy an intermediate region, and late timepoints should occupy a distinct region marked by a shift in principal component loadings. The transition window is identified where clustering membership exhibits the greatest shift—i.e., where samples transition from one cluster to another.

Silhouette scores or within-cluster sum of squares can quantify the cohesion of samples within each timepoint and the separation between adjacent timepoints. A marked increase in between-cluster distance (or decrease in within-cluster distance) at specific timepoint boundaries indicates a transition window[1][4].

### Co-expression Module Dynamics and Module Switching

Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) applied to the entire time-course dataset will partition genes into modules of co-expressed genes[13][16]. Each module is summarized by its eigengene (the first principal component of module members), which represents the module's mean expression level in each sample. Plotting eigengenes across time reveals how each functional module changes during the progression.

An exhaustion-enriched module should show increasing eigengene values over early-to-mid timepoints and plateau thereafter. An aging-like or stress module should show little activity initially, remain relatively flat, then sharply increase during the transition window. A point where an exhaustion module eigengene begins to plateau while a stress/death module begins to rise sharply defines the transition window. This crossing point indicates a shift in the dominant regulatory program—from exhaustion maintenance toward aging-like stress accumulation.

To validate module interpretation, genes within each module should be subjected to gene ontology and pathway enrichment analysis. Exhaustion modules should be enriched for immune checkpoint signaling and TCR-related processes[1][4]. Aging/stress modules should be enriched for senescence, DNA damage responses, apoptosis, and mitochondrial dysfunction[21][46].

### Death Program Signatures and Apoptotic Burden

To anchor the "Death" component of the axis, explicit apoptosis, necrosis, and ER stress signatures should be quantified. MSigDB Hallmark gene sets include HALLMARK_APOPTOSIS (genes mediating programmed cell death via caspase activation), HALLMARK_UNFOLDED_PROTEIN_RESPONSE, and p53 pathway signatures[24][47]. Per-sample enrichment scores for these gene sets should increase in late timepoints. If the aging-like score and apoptosis score show a strong correlation across samples, this supports the interpretation that the aging-like module reflects stress-induced cell death programs.

Additionally, genes encoding pro-apoptotic BH3 proteins (BAX, PUMA, NOXA), caspase activators (APAF1), and death receptors (TNFRSF1A, TNFRSF9) should show increased expression in late timepoints. Conversely, anti-apoptotic genes (BCL2, MCL1) may show decreased expression. The emergence of this death signature during the transition window provides strong evidence that the window indeed marks a transition toward terminal viability loss.

## Nominating and Validating Rejuvenation Targets

### Candidate Selection Focused on the Transition Window

Rejuvenation targets should be selected on the basis of their dynamics specifically within and immediately preceding the identified transition window. Genes showing sharp increases in expression at the window boundary, with high fold-change between the pre-transition and transition states, represent candidates for inhibition (if the increase is associated with worsening exhaustion/aging-like scores). Conversely, genes showing sharp decreases at the window boundary, whose restoration might reverse the transition, represent candidates for activation.

To identify these window-focused candidates, time-course differential expression should be computed specifically for contrasts bracketing the transition interval (e.g., early [t1-t2] vs mid [t3-t4] vs late [t5-t6], with the window falling between mid and late). Genes with high effect sizes (e.g., log2 fold-change > 1 in magnitude, adjusted p-value < 0.05) and monotonic direction across these intervals should be prioritized.

Alternatively, intersection analysis can identify genes whose expression is (i) correlated with exhaustion+aging-like combined score, (ii) located in WGCNA modules showing transition-window dynamics, and (iii) ranked as top drivers by time-course DE tools. Such multi-criteria selection is more robust than relying on any single metric.

### Transcription Factor Activity Inference

Because transcription factors are particularly powerful intervention points (a single TF can modulate dozens of downstream targets), inferring transcription factor activity (TFA) from bulk RNA-seq represents a key step[26][29]. Methods such as VIPER (Virtual Inference of Protein-activity by Enriched Regulon analysis) infer TF activity by measuring differential expression of curated sets of TF target genes (regulons), accounting for the sign of each regulatory interaction (activation vs repression)[26][29]. DoRothEA provides a high-confidence database of TF-target interactions curated from ChIP-seq, literature, and TF knockout experiments[29]. Applying VIPER with DoRothEA as the prior network will identify which transcription factors show altered activity across the time course.

TFs exhibiting high activity early and sustained high activity through the transition window (consistent with driving exhaustion) are candidates for inhibition. TFs showing decreasing activity at the transition window (consistent with loss of function enabling aging-like progression) are candidates for activation. Cross-referencing TF activity changes with promoter motif analysis in the DNA of genes showing transition-window expression shifts provides further evidence for which TFs are mechanistically responsible.

### Network-Based Prioritization and Driver Identification

The WGCNA modules identified earlier provide a natural network scaffold. Within exhaustion-enriched or aging-like-enriched modules, genes can be ranked by module membership (kME), a measure of how tightly each gene correlates with the module eigengene[13][16]. Genes with high kME are considered module hubs and are likely to be more central to the module's biological function. A hub gene in an exhaustion module that shows increased expression at the transition window is a strong candidate for inhibition.

To assess global network centrality, co-expression networks can be visualized and analyzed using tools such as Cytoscape[13]. Candidate targets occupying central positions (high degree, high betweenness centrality) are more likely to be regulatory hubs whose modulation will have broad transcriptomic consequences compared to peripheral genes.

Additionally, protein-protein interaction networks can be overlaid (using databases such as STRING or BioGRID) to identify whether candidate targets interact directly with known exhaustion regulators (e.g., TOX, NR4A factors, NFAT). A candidate that both correlates with exhaustion-module eigengene and physically interacts with TOX is particularly convincing as a co-regulator worthy of targeting.

### Opposing Regulation Analysis: Rejuvenation Direction Prediction

For each candidate target, the expected direction of intervention (inhibition vs activation) should be justified by an "opposing regulation" analysis. If the goal is rejuvenation, the expected transcriptomic outcome of modulating the target should be:

1. **Downshift of exhaustion signature score**: Per-sample exhaustion score should decrease if the target is inhibited or if activation of an opposing target occurs.
2. **Downshift of aging-like signature score**: The emerging stress/senescence/aging-like module should be suppressed.
3. **Upshift of effector and memory-like programs**: Genes associated with cytotoxic function (GZMB, PRF1, IFNG, TNF), TCF-1-driven stemness, and memory-associated transcription factors should increase.
4. **Metabolic improvement**: Genes related to mitochondrial biogenesis, glycolytic capacity, and antioxidant responses should increase.

For a candidate target gene, correlation analysis can test whether per-sample expression of that gene is positively associated with exhaustion+aging-like scores (in which case inhibition is warranted) or negatively associated (in which case activation is warranted). Furthermore, a simulated modulation analysis using gene set directionality testing (e.g., examining whether the set of genes positively regulated by the target is enriched for anti-exhaustion/anti-aging-like biology) provides additional evidence.

### Evidence-Backed Rejuvenation Targets: Proposed Examples and Mechanistic Rationale

#### TOX Inhibition as a Primary Target

The thymocyte selection-associated HMG box (TOX) transcription factor represents the most thoroughly validated driver of T cell exhaustion[12][38][55]. TOX expression is low in naive T cells, transiently induced during acute infection but then rapidly silenced, and persistently elevated in chronic exhaustion[12][55]. In the tumor context, TOX rises early with chronic antigen stimulation and remains elevated; it is enriched in the exhaustion module and likely shows continuing increase through the transition window as cells become terminally exhausted[1][12][55].

TOX directly binds chromatin at the promoters of inhibitory receptor genes (*PDCD1*, *LAG3*, *HAVCR2*, *TIGIT*), promoting their continuous expression and suppressing degradation of PD-1 protein at the cell surface[12][55]. Mechanistically, TOX functions as a "master regulator" by recruiting chromatin remodeling complexes and altering the epigenetic landscape to lock in the exhaustion program[55]. TOX expression is regulated upstream by NFAT downstream of sustained TCR signaling; notably, short-term TOX expression is insufficient for terminal exhaustion, but sustained expression is required for progression toward terminal dysfunction[55].

**Intervention direction**: Inhibition of TOX during the transition window is predicted to reverse exhaustion. Supporting evidence includes studies showing that TOX-deficient CD8+ T cells maintain higher cytokine production and reduced expression of inhibitory receptors[55]. In CAR-T cell contexts, TOX-deficient engineered T cells demonstrate enhanced persistence and antitumor activity[55][58].

**RNA-seq evidence expected**: In time-course data, TOX expression should show early rise followed by continued elevation or plateau through the transition window. Within WGCNA exhaustion modules, TOX should show high module membership. TOX expression should be strongly positively correlated with exhaustion score and maintained correlation with aging-like score through mid-to-late timepoints. Genes directly downstream of TOX (inhibitory receptors, NFAT-NR4A axis members) should show co-expression patterns.

**Opposing regulation**: Simulated TOX inhibition (computationally assessing the expected consequences of TOX downregulation on its known target genes) should predict downregulation of PD-1, LAG-3, and other inhibitory receptors, coupled with upregulation of effector cytokines and reduced expression of senescence-associated markers. The expected shift would move the transcriptional state away from the exhaustion module toward a more memory-like or quiescent non-exhausted state.

#### NR4A Family Modulation (NR4A1 Inhibition, NR4A3 Modulation)

The nuclear orphan receptor family NR4A (NR4A1, NR4A2, NR4A3) represents a second critical bottleneck in the exhaustion-aging-like axis[20][23][55]. These transcription factors are immediate early genes rapidly and transiently induced by TCR signaling in acute responses but persistently expressed in chronic exhaustion[20][23]. NR4A1 and NR4A3 directly bind exhaustion-associated gene promoters and cooperate with TOX in a positive feedback loop to propagate the exhaustion program[20][55].

Mechanistically, NR4A1 inhibits AP-1 function (the c-JUN/c-FOS heterodimer), preventing expression of effector genes and favoring exhaustion-associated transcriptional programs[20][55]. NR4A3 expression early during T cell activation shifts differentiation away from memory precursor and central memory cells toward short-lived effector cells; NR4A3 deficiency preferentially generates memory CD8+ T cells with enhanced cytokine production[23]. This suggests that NR4A3 inhibition during the transition window could redirect cells away from the terminal exhaustion fate.

**Intervention direction**: NR4A1 inhibition is predicted to alleviate exhaustion by restoring AP-1 activity and preventing NR4A-NFAT positive feedback. NR4A3 modulation is more complex: early NR4A3 inhibition might prevent memory loss and enhance memory generation, while transition-window inhibition might prevent terminal exhaustion; conversely, reducing NR4A3 levels early could be beneficial while maintaining some NR4A3 activity might be needed for other immune functions.

**RNA-seq evidence expected**: NR4A1, NR4A2, and NR4A3 should show early induction (within hours/days of antigen exposure) and sustained expression through the time course, with expression continuing to increase or plateau at the transition window. These genes should be co-expressed with TOX, NFAT, and other exhaustion drivers in WGCNA modules. Their target genes (including PDCD1, LAG3, and repressed AP-1 targets) should show reciprocal expression patterns.

**Opposing regulation**: NR4A1 inhibition should predict upregulation of AP-1-target genes (c-FOS, JunB, c-JUN targets like cytokines and growth-promoting genes) and reduced expression of exhaustion markers. The expected shift would restore effector capacity while reducing checkpoint receptor expression.

#### TCF-1 (TCF7) Preservation or Activation

In stark contrast to TOX and NR4A, TCF-1 (transcription factor 7, encoded by TCF7) maintains stem-like qualities in T cells and is expressed at high levels in progenitor exhausted T cells but lost in terminally exhausted populations[19][22][59]. TCF-1 is positively associated with the ability to respond to PD-1 blockade therapy; T cells expressing TCF-1 show better proliferative potential and are more likely to mount successful anti-tumor responses when checkpoint inhibition is applied[19][22].

Mechanistically, TCF-1 activates genes involved in stemness, self-renewal, and metabolic flexibility (including IL7R, CCR7, and genes linked to quiescence)[22][59]. TCF-1 expression is suppressed by inflammatory signals, particularly those driven by activated AP-1 complexes and certain cytokines; its loss is associated with irreversible commitment to terminal differentiation[22][59]. Interestingly, TCF-1 is not uniformly downregulated in exhaustion—it persists in progenitor exhausted cells—but becomes lost as cells progress to terminal exhaustion.

**Intervention direction**: Activation or preservation of TCF-1 during the transition window (particularly in progenitor exhausted cells) is predicted to maintain stemness, prevent terminal exhaustion, and preserve response to immunotherapy. This might be achieved through inhibition of the inflammatory pathways that suppress TCF-1 (e.g., AP-1 inhibition might paradoxically preserve TCF-1 in some contexts, though AP-1 activation is otherwise expected to be beneficial for effector function).

**RNA-seq evidence expected**: TCF7 expression should show strong early elevation in exhaustion, followed by a divergence: progenitor exhausted cells maintain TCF7 expression, while terminally exhausted cells lose it. At the transition window, cells with high TCF7 should represent a biologically distinct population from TCF7-low cells, detectable by UMAP/PCA clustering. The loss of TCF7 at the transition window should correlate with increased aging-like score and loss of proliferative potential.

**Opposing regulation**: Simulated TCF-1 activation should predict upregulation of stemness/memory genes (IL7R, CCR7, FOXO1, BCL6), reduced terminal exhaustion marker expression, and preservation of proliferative capacity markers (e.g., reduced upregulation of cell cycle arrest genes).

#### NFAT Modulation and Partnerless NFAT Breaking

NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cells) represents an upstream regulator of both TOX and NR4A, sitting at a critical node in the exhaustion transcriptional hierarchy[9][12][55]. Chronic TCR stimulation leads to sustained NFAT nuclear translocation, where NFAT binds as homodimers (in the absence of AP-1 partners) and drives exhaustion-associated transcriptional programs. This "partnerless NFAT" state directly promotes expression of TOX, NR4A, and inhibitory receptors[9][55].

Mechanistically, calcineurin-NFAT signaling is essential for initiating exhaustion but becomes pathogenic when sustained. The key transition point is when NFAT-AP-1 heterodimer formation (which produces balanced effector and survival signals) is replaced by partnerless NFAT homodimers (which drives exhaustion and senescence)[55]. Breaking this shift—either by inhibiting NFAT nuclear import/activity or by restoring AP-1 activity to allow heterodimer formation—could redirect T cells away from exhaustion.

**Intervention direction**: Direct NFAT inhibition (e.g., via calcineurin inhibitors like cyclosporine, though with caveats regarding immunosuppression) or indirect approaches promoting AP-1 activity (via enhancement of AP-1 components or inhibition of NR4A-mediated AP-1 repression) could interrupt the exhaustion program.

**RNA-seq evidence expected**: NFAT target genes (TOX, NR4A family, PDCD1, LAG3) should show strong coordinated upregulation at the transition window. AP-1 component expression (c-FOS, c-JUN, JUNB, BATF—though BATF is also part of exhaustion programs) should become decoupled, with AP-1-driven effector genes showing suppression while NFAT-driven exhaustion genes show sustained elevation. The loss of NFAT-AP-1 heterodimer formation signatures (assessed via motif analysis or TF activity inference) should correlate with exhaustion progression.

**Opposing regulation**: Breaking partnerless NFAT (through AP-1 restoration or NFAT inhibition) should predict upregulation of AP-1 target genes and a shift in exhaustion-module eigengene trajectory toward stabilization or reversal.

#### p16INK4a (CDKN2A) Targeting and Senescence Alleviation

Cellular senescence, characterized by irreversible cell cycle arrest and pro-inflammatory secretory programs, emerges as a component of terminal T cell exhaustion[46]. p16INK4a expression markedly increases in exhausted CD8+ T cells and represents a key mediator of the senescence growth arrest[46]. The p16INK4a-retinoblastoma (RB) pathway enforces permanent G1/S checkpoint arrest, making senescence cells refractory to proliferative signals even after checkpoint blockade.

The DNA damage response accumulation in exhausted T cells, triggered by repeated antigen stimulation and ROS accumulation, drives p38MAPK signaling which preferentially upregulates p16INK4a[46]. This represents a later event than initial exhaustion-marker upregulation, consistent with p16INK4a being part of the aging-like module emerging at the transition window.

**Intervention direction**: p16INK4a targeting (via targeted protein degradation, antisense approaches, or indirect inhibition of its upstream p38MAPK driver) during the transition window could reverse senescence features in exhausted T cells. Notably, CAR-T cells with p16INK4a targeted show restored functionality[46].

**RNA-seq evidence expected**: p16INK4a (CDKN2A) expression should be relatively low early, show modest early elevation, then dramatically increase at the transition window and in terminal timepoints. Co-expression with senescence-associated genes (p21CIP1, CDKN1A; SASP components; DNA damage response genes) should be evident. p16INK4a expression should be strongly positively correlated with aging-like score and negatively correlated with proliferation-associated genes (MKI67, CCNA2, CCNB2).

**Opposing regulation**: p16INK4a targeting should predict upregulation of cell cycle genes and reduced expression of senescence-associated inflammation, allowing exhausted T cells to re-enter the cell cycle in response to co-stimulation or checkpoint blockade.

## Critical Transition Window Characteristics and Biological Justification

The identified transition window should exhibit the following characteristics to constitute a genuine state transition rather than a gradual continuum:

**Temporal clustering shift**: PCA/UMAP clustering of samples should show late-window samples occupying a distinct region from mid-window samples, with cluster identity shifting more dramatically at the window boundary than at other timepoint intervals.

**Module eigengene crossing**: The exhaustion-module eigengene should plateau or begin declining, while aging-like/stress-module eigengenes should sharply rise, with the crossing occurring within a narrow temporal window.

**Apoptosis signature emergence**: Hallmark apoptosis and p53 pathway signatures should show marked elevation specifically within the transition window, not gradually across all late timepoints.

**Coordinated expression shifts**: Multiple independent signatures (apoptosis, DNA damage response, mitochondrial dysfunction, SASP-like cytokines, p16INK4a accumulation) should all show synchronized elevation at the window boundary, suggesting a coordinated state transition rather than independent processes.

**Biological plausibility**: The transition window should align with expected kinetics of cellular stress accumulation and senescence induction (typically occurring after days to weeks of repeated antigenic stimulation, depending on the model system).

## Therapeutic Mapping and Druggability Assessment

### Target-Drug Harmonization and Directionality Matching

Once rejuvenation targets are nominated, existing drug-target databases (such as DrugBank, which contains over 13,000 drugs and their known targets) can be queried to identify compounds that modulate the proposed targets[49][50][52]. The critical step is ensuring directionality matching: for targets nominated for inhibition, inhibitors, antagonists, or negative allosteric modulators should be prioritized; for targets nominated for activation, agonists or positive allosteric modulators should be selected.

Importantly, many drugs exhibit polypharmacology—binding and modulating multiple unintended targets beyond their primary target. The degree of off-target activity should be assessed by examining the complete target profile. For example, BTK inhibitors (a class being explored for immune modulation[57][60]) broadly suppress B cell and T cell signaling through multiple pathways, raising concerns about immunosuppression that might paradoxically worsen T cell function.

### Feasibility and Limitation Assessment

Several practical and biological limitations should be considered:

**Target druggability**: Transcription factors (such as TOX, NR4A) are historically considered "undruggable" because they lack deep binding pockets suitable for small-molecule inhibition. However, recent advances in targeted protein degradation (PROTAC technology, where small molecules recruit transcription factors to E3 ubiquitin ligases for degradation) have made TF targeting increasingly feasible[55][58]. Gene therapy approaches (directly introducing dominant-negative TOX, or using antisense oligonucleotides) represent alternatives but face delivery and specificity challenges.

**Cell-type specificity**: Bulk RNA-seq reflects a mixed population of cell types; if tumors contain multiple T cell subsets (CD4+, CD8+, Foxp3+ regulatory T cells, γδ T cells), modulating a target may have divergent effects on different subsets. Single-cell resolution would be needed to validate that targets are modulated primarily in the desired CD8+ T cell compartment. However, given that the problem specifies bulk RNA-seq, acknowledging this caveat is appropriate.

**Immune homeostasis risks**: Many exhaustion-enforcing genes (such as p16INK4a-mediated senescence) evolved as tumor suppressors to prevent malignant transformation. Systemically inhibiting these programs in T cells might inadvertently increase malignancy risk in other cell types, requiring careful balancing of therapeutic benefit against long-term safety.

**Clinical precedence and development stage**: Some targets (e.g., PD-1 pathway components) have well-established clinical-grade inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies already in use; others may have only preclinical-stage compounds or no known inhibitors at all.

### Integration with Checkpoint Blockade and Combination Strategies

The proposed rejuvenation targets should be evaluated not only as monotherapies but in combination with existing standard-of-care approaches, particularly PD-1/PD-L1 blockade. For example, TOX inhibition is predicted to enhance the effects of PD-1 blockade by not only removing the direct PD-1 blockade-resistant exhaustion program but also allowing reinvigorated T cells (whose PD-1 blockade generates effector-like exhausted cells) to maintain proliferative capacity and avoid terminal exhaustion[55][58].

Similarly, targeting senescence pathways (p16INK4a, p38MAPK) in combination with checkpoint blockade might restore proliferative capacity to T cells that would otherwise enter senescence despite PD-1 blockade[46].

The synergy or antagonism between proposed targets and checkpoint blockade should be assessed by examining whether multi-target modulation produces non-additive (synergistic) transcriptomic shifts, detectable by comparing actual observed expression changes to the sum of predicted individual effects.

## Integration with Broader Immunotherapy Context

### CAR-T Cell Optimization and Adoptive T Cell Therapy

The rejuvenation targets identified through this analysis are directly applicable to engineering improved CAR-T cells for adoptive T cell therapy. CAR-T cell products approved by the FDA (including Kymriah, Yescarta, and others) are manufactured from patient-derived T cells that are expanded ex vivo, transduced with a chimeric antigen receptor, and re-infused. A persistent clinical limitation is that CAR-T cells exhaust in vivo, particularly against solid tumors with suppressive microenvironments[55][58].

Nominating targets that prevent CAR-T exhaustion during manufacturing or that enable more persistent in vivo responses directly translates to improved clinical outcomes. Pre-clinical studies have demonstrated that CAR-T cells with disrupted TOX expression or enhanced memory signatures show superior persistence and antitumor activity[55][58]. Future CAR-T products incorporating these target modifications (e.g., TOX-deficient, NR4A-inhibited, or TCF-1-overexpressing CAR-T cells) represent a near-term translational pathway.

### mRNA-Based Therapeutic Approaches for Immune Rejuvenation

Recent work demonstrates that mRNA-delivered cytokines (IL-7, FLT3-L, DLL1) to hepatocytes can restore T cell production and rejuvenate aged immune systems[31][34]. This approach could be extended using mRNA encoding inhibitory versions of exhaustion drivers (e.g., dominant-negative TOX, repressor isoforms of NR4A factors) or activating versions of preservation factors (e.g., TCF-1 with constitutively active mutations).

The advantage of mRNA approaches is that they provide transient, titratable expression without permanent genetic modification, reducing long-term safety concerns while enabling temporal control (mRNA can be re-dosed) consistent with the identification of discrete transition windows where intervention is most impactful.

## Conclusion and Recommendations for Prospective Analysis

The framework presented here provides a comprehensive approach to discovering and validating rejuvenation targets along the T cell exhaustion-aging-death axis using time-course RNA-seq data. The key principles are:

1. **Ground signatures in observed transcriptional dynamics** rather than a priori assumptions, validated against established aging and exhaustion resources.

2. **Distinguish discrete transitions from gradual changes** using changepoint detection, WGCNA module dynamics, and multivariate clustering to identify a biologically meaningful intervention window.

3. **Prioritize targets that sit at regulatory bottlenecks** (transcription factors, signaling nodes) whose modulation will produce coordinated shifts in exhaustion and aging-like signatures.

4. **Provide multi-line evidence** for each nominated target, including expression dynamics, network centrality, correlations with signatures, and mechanistic rationale.

5. **Assess druggability and clinical feasibility** while acknowledging limitations of bulk RNA-seq and inherent trade-offs between anti-exhaustion benefits and immunosuppression risks.

The identified targets—TOX, NR4A factors, preservation of TCF-1, NFAT modulation, and senescence-pathway intervention—represent current best estimates from the literature and should be validated specifically in the provided dataset. The analysis framework enables systematic evaluation of any proposed target and provides a transparent mechanistic basis for clinical translation.

## References and Supporting Evidence Summary

This analysis synthesizes insights from single-cell RNA-seq studies of exhausted T cells showing transcriptional hierarchies and state transitions[1][4][12], time-course transcriptomics approaches including ImpulseDE2, maSigPro, and Trendy for temporal pattern detection[8][11][14], co-expression network analyses via WGCNA[13][16], transcription factor activity inference using VIPER and DoRothEA[26][29], aging-related gene resources including GenAge and MSigDB aging signatures[3][6][7][10], senescence mechanisms in T cells involving p16INK4a and p38MAPK[46], and recent work on rejuvenation via CAR-T optimization and mRNA-based immune modulation[31][34][55][58]. The intersection of exhaustion biology and aging/senescence biology reveals that T cell dysfunction progresses along multiple coordinated axes, each potentially targetable at discrete windows where reversal remains possible.
