  "original_problem_text": "Problem 5. [Rejuvenation Target Discovery Along the T Cell Exhaustion–Aging–Death Axis]\n\n\nBackground\nIn the tumor microenvironment, T cells are subjected to chronic and repeated antigen stimulation over time, leading to the acquisition of a T cell exhaustion program characterized by reduced effector function and altered transcriptional states. As this process progresses, a subset of exhausted T cells is observed to exhibit stress-induced, aging-like transcriptional programs, which may ultimately culminate in cellular senescence and cell death.\nIn this problem, T cell exhaustion is assumed to represent a progressive trajectory toward aging-like dysfunction and terminal loss of cellular viability. Reversing this trajectory—particularly at critical transition points—can be conceptualized as a form of immune rejuvenation.\nYou are provided with time-course bulk RNA-seq data of T cells following tumor challenge. Using this dataset, your task is to define and analyze the exhaustion–aging–death axis and propose gene-level intervention targets capable of reversing this progression.\nThe following publicly available aging-related resources may be used, among others:\n•\tGenAge (Human Aging Genomic Resources, HAGR)\nhttps://genomics.senescence.info/genes/\n•\tMSigDB Aging / Senescence Gene Sets\nhttps://www.gsea-msigdb.org\n\nTask Overview\nUsing the provided time-course T cell bulk RNA-seq data, identify candidate rejuvenation targets that could reverse T cell exhaustion and aging-like programs before terminal cell death.\nYour analysis should be explicitly grounded in RNA-seq–based evidence and focused on the intersection between exhaustion and aging-like transcriptional states.\n(A) Quantification of Exhaustion and Aging-Like Programs\n•\tDefine a T cell exhaustion score and an aging-like score using transcriptional signatures derived from the time-course data.\n•\tVisualize and describe how these scores change over time following tumor challenge.\n(B) Identification of the Critical Transition Window\n•\tIdentify and define a key transition window along the\n“Exhaustion → Aging-Like → Death” axis.\n•\tJustify why this time interval represents a biologically meaningful state transition, rather than a gradual continuum.\n(C) Proposal of Rejuvenation Target Genes\n•\tPropose candidate target genes capable of reversing or disrupting the exhaustion–aging trajectory during the identified transition window.\n•\tFor each proposed target:\no\tSpecify the direction of intervention: inhibition or activation\no\tProvide RNA-seq–based evidence, including:\n\tDirection of expression change over time\n\tNetwork or pathway-level context\n\tOpposing regulation relative to exhaustion or aging-like signatures\nYour reasoning should explicitly connect gene modulation to the expected rejuvenation-like transcriptional shift.\n(D) Optional (Bonus): Therapeutic Mapping\n•\tUsing the provided drug–target dataset, identify:\no\tExisting drugs or compounds that could modulate the proposed targets\n•\tBriefly discuss feasibility, specificity, or limitations of these interventions\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "Using the provided time-course bulk RNA-seq of T cells post tumor challenge, define (i) a T cell exhaustion score and (ii) an aging-like score that are explicitly derived/validated from the dataset. Compute per-sample scores and visualize their trajectories over time. Provide a clear narrative describing score dynamics (onset, slope, plateau), and relate them back to transcriptional evidence (key genes/pathways driving each score).",
      "suggested_approach": "1) Preprocess & normalize: perform QC (library size, outliers), normalize counts (DESeq2 size factors or edgeR TMM; for linear modeling consider limma-voom). Account for batch/replicate structure in the design matrix.\n2) Build exhaustion signature grounded in data: identify genes showing monotonic increase/decrease along time or significantly changing vs baseline using time-course DE tools (ImpulseDE2, maSigPro, DESeq2 likelihood ratio test). Cross-check that canonical exhaustion markers/pathways are enriched (e.g., inhibitory receptors, TOX/NR4A axis, diminished cytotoxicity modules) without hard-coding them as the only definition.\n3) Build aging-like signature grounded in data: extract a gene module that turns on later and resembles stress/senescence/aging programs by enrichment against aging resources (e.g., MSigDB aging/senescence gene sets; GenAge gene enrichment) and stress/death-related Hallmarks (p53, apoptosis, inflammatory/SASP-like cytokines if present). Ensure the signature is anchored in observed time-course patterns.\n4) Scoring method: compute per-sample signature scores using GSVA/ssGSEA (recommended), or z-scored average of signature genes with sign-corrected direction (up vs down components). Consider separating “up” and “down” components for interpretability.\n5) Visualization & statistics: plot scores vs time (line plots with confidence intervals; LOESS fits), test time trends (mixed models/ANOVA with time as factor; or spline regression), and report effect sizes between adjacent timepoints.\n6) Provide gene-level drivers: show top contributing genes per score (loading/weights if using PCA/PLS; or highest correlation with score) and pathway enrichment (fgsea).",

      "description": "Identify a discrete, biologically meaningful transition window along the inferred “Exhaustion → Aging-like → Death” progression rather than treating changes as purely gradual. Define the window boundaries (timepoints/interval), quantify the evidence for a state shift, and provide RNA-seq–based justification that the window marks a change in transcriptional regime (e.g., module switching, inflection point, emergence of death/stress programs).",
      "suggested_approach": "1) Change-point/segmentation on scores: apply segmented regression or formal change-point detection (e.g., Bayesian change point, Pruned Exact Linear Time, or the 'ruptures' framework conceptually) to exhaustion and aging-like score trajectories to detect inflection points.\n2) Multivariate state shift: perform PCA/UMAP on normalized expression and test whether samples cluster by early/mid/late time; quantify separation (silhouette score) and identify the time interval where cluster membership flips.\n3) Time-course module dynamics: run WGCNA (or similar co-expression module detection) and track module eigengenes over time. Identify the time where an “exhaustion module” stops increasing and an “aging/death/stress module” sharply rises (module crossing).\n4) Death/proximal viability signatures: quantify apoptosis/necrosis/ER stress/mitochondrial dysfunction signatures (e.g., MSigDB Hallmark Apoptosis, p53 pathway, unfolded protein response). Use these to support the ‘toward death’ interpretation.\n5) Statistical justification: compare adjacent intervals with differential expression contrasts (t_k vs t_{k-1}) and report whether one interval shows an unusually large transcriptional jump (number of DE genes, effect-size distribution shift), consistent with a transition window.\n6) Deliverable: define window as [t_i, t_j] and provide 2–3 orthogonal lines of evidence (score change-point + module switch + DE burst / emergence of death signatures).",

      "description": "Propose candidate rejuvenation intervention genes that could reverse or disrupt the exhaustion-to-aging-like trajectory specifically during the identified transition window. For each gene: specify intervention direction (inhibit vs activate), provide RNA-seq evidence (direction and timing of expression change), place the gene in pathway/network context, and explicitly argue how modulating it would oppose the exhaustion and/or aging-like signatures (i.e., expected rejuvenation-like shift).",
      "suggested_approach": "1) Candidate selection focused on the transition window: prioritize genes that (a) change sharply within the window (time-course DE focused on window boundaries), (b) correlate strongly with exhaustion/aging-like scores, and/or (c) sit in modules that switch on/off during the transition.\n2) Regulatory inference: infer upstream regulators and transcription factor activity using DoRothEA/VIPER (TF activity), PROGENy (pathway activity), or comparable approaches on bulk RNA-seq to prioritize controllable nodes (TFs, signaling adaptors, chromatin regulators).\n3) Network context: build a co-expression network (WGCNA) and/or map candidates onto PPI networks (conceptually) to compute centrality within exhaustion/aging modules; highlight whether the gene is a hub/driver.\n4) “Opposing regulation” test: define a rejuvenation direction as negative association with exhaustion+aging scores and positive association with effector/memory-like programs (e.g., cytotoxicity, IL7/TCF7-like programs, mitochondrial fitness). Quantify with correlations/linear models and perform enrichment to show that candidate modulation would downshift exhaustion/aging-like gene sets.\n5) Intervention direction logic: \n   - If gene increases with worsening exhaustion/aging-like score and is a putative driver/hub → propose inhibition.\n   - If gene decreases and is linked to stem-like/memory/repair metabolism → propose activation.\n6) Evidence package per target: mini-dossier including (i) expression trajectory plot, (ii) window-specific fold change, (iii) module membership and module-time behavior, (iv) enriched pathways connected to that module, (v) predicted downstream signature shift if modulated (e.g., via gene set directionality analysis).\n7) Output: rank targets with a transparent scoring rubric (window-specific effect size, driver likelihood, druggability proxy if available, and predicted anti-exhaustion/anti-aging-like impact).",
