# Problem
Problem 1. [Troubleshooting an Ribosome Profiling Experiment]
You are given a ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) wet-lab protocol and a set of incident reports from teams who attempted the workflow. Your job is to diagnose the root causes, propose fixes, and design a validation and prevention plan.

Provided artifact

-	protocol.md: The protocol “as distributed” to teams.
-	reference.fa: a single transcript reference sequence (toy_gene).
-	reads.fastq.gz: 50-nt single-end reads (a few hundred total).

Constraints

-	Assume no ability to run new wet-lab experiments during the competition.
-	You may propose additional experiments/QC as recommendations, but your core answers must be supported by the protocol text and the incident reports below.

Background (what “good” usually looks like)
Ribo-seq aims to sequence ribosome-protected RNA fragments. Typical success indicators include:

-	A narrow protected-fragment size distribution after digestion/selection (often ~28–34 nt; may vary by system).
-	Clear enrichment of coding-region signal and strong 3-nt periodicity in aligned reads.
-	A clean final library trace (dominant peak at expected library size, limited adapter/primer-dimer).
-	Reasonable PCR duplication; if UMIs are present, deduplication should not saturate at extremely small numbers of unique UMIs.

This protocol also encodes a UMI in the adapter/read structure (random bases denoted by N).

Competition framing
There are several issues across the incidents:

-	Some are protocol/document defects present in the originally distributed protocol.
-	There are some execution mistakes (not written in the protocol) by the experimenter. Only observations that may be derived from the mistakes are documented.

Sub-Problems
1-1. Incident A
Task: Based on the report and observations, propose the most likely root cause(s) and the next steps to confirm and fix the issue.

User report

“We followed the protocol end-to-end, but the final libraries are kind of messy and the yield jumps around between runs. Sometimes we get a decent peak; other times it’s smeary and hard to quantify.”

Observations

-	TapeStation/Bioanalyzer traces show a main library peak plus elevated baseline/smear and occasional small peaks.
-	qPCR-based quantification shows poor amplification efficiency (steeper Ct variance between replicates than expected).
-	A260/230 (when measured) is low in some runs, suggesting carryover of salts/solvents.
-	Repeating cleanup sometimes improves the trace but not consistently.

1-2. Incident B
Task: Based on the report and observations, propose the most likely root cause(s) and the next steps to confirm and fix the issue.

User report

“Same reagents and same protocol, but different people in the lab get different outcomes. PCR is sometimes fine and sometimes barely works. We didn’t intentionally change anything, so we’re not sure what part is sensitive.”

Observations

-	Strong run-to-run variability depending on operator.
-	PCR sometimes fails or needs extra cycles; when it does amplify, size looks plausible.
-	Repeat attempt with an extended bead air-dry (and careful removal of residual ethanol) restores normal amplification without changing reagents.
-	No single protocol text change explains why only some operators see the issue.

1-3. Incident C
Task: Based on the report and observations, propose the most likely root cause(s) and the next steps to confirm and fix the issue.

User report

“RNA recovery seemed OK, and the library has a peak, but the sequencing results don’t look like our past Ribo-seq runs. The fragments seem bigger than we expected and the usual ‘frame pattern’ isn’t obvious.”

Observations

-	Gel/fragment QC of protected fragments shows a broad distribution with substantial material >40 nt.
-	Sequencing QC:
-	Overall alignment rate is acceptable.
-	3-nt periodicity at P-sites is weak/near-absent.
-	Reads show increased mapping outside CDS compared to prior internal datasets.
-	Library yield after PCR is not obviously low; final library peak exists but downstream interpretability is poor.

1-4. Incident D
Task: Based on the report and observations, propose the most likely root cause(s) and the next steps to confirm and fix the issue.

User report

“The bioinformatics side is giving us strange duplication numbers. After deduplication, it looks like almost everything collapses into a tiny number of molecules, which doesn’t match how much input we started with.”

Observations

-	After UMI extraction, the number of distinct UMIs observed is extremely small.
-	Deduplication collapses a large fraction of reads even in moderately sized datasets.
-	A histogram of observed UMI strings is heavily concentrated in a tiny set; uniqueness saturates early.
-	Downstream quantification across genes is unusually noisy and sensitive to small pipeline changes.

1-5. Incident E
Task: Based on the report and observations, propose the most likely root cause(s) and the next steps to confirm and fix the issue.

User report

“We keep getting mostly short junk products instead of a clean library peak. We tried repeating the run and got basically the same outcome. We did make fresh stocks recently, but we didn’t change anything on purpose.”

Observations

-	A quick denaturing gel check right after the ligation step shows the RNA band at the same position as the pre-ligation control, with no clear shifted product band.
-	The final library trace is dominated by short artifacts; the expected library peak is weak or absent.
-	Replacing enzymes (fresh ligase, fresh buffers) does not reliably recover the expected product; the failure is reproducible across repeats.
-	Input RNA quality metrics (RIN/TapeStation) look acceptable and similar to runs that worked previously.
-	In failed sequencing runs, the first ~20–30 bases of Read 1 are highly enriched for primer/adapter-like sequence, but the expected linker-specific prefix from the protocol appears at very low frequency.
-	The new oligo shipment paperwork differs from prior orders in at least one of: molecule type (RNA vs DNA), terminal modifications, or purification grade (e.g., HPLC vs desalted).
1-6. Preliminary data analysis
You are given a small pilot Ribo-seq dataset focused on a single transcript. Process the raw FASTQ into a per-position footprint count array and summarize what the data suggests.

Expected deliverables

-	counts_raw.csv and counts_dedup.csv: counts per transcript position (state your coordinate convention clearly).
-	A histogram plot showing the distribution of 5' start positions across the transcript (raw and deduplicated side-by-side).
-	A single HTML report that, for this single-transcript dataset, summarizes basic QC suitable for Ribo-seq and your interpretation.
-	A written interpretation: what (if anything) looks biologically meaningful, and 2–4 concrete follow-up checks or next steps.


# Original Answer
## 1-1. Incident A (messy libraries, unstable yield)
### Most likely root cause(s)
1) **Carryover of cleanup contaminants (salts/solvents) into enzymatic steps**, consistent with:
- **Low A260/230** in some runs (classic for guanidinium/phenol/ethanol/salts).
- **Poor qPCR amplification efficiency and high Ct variance**, consistent with polymerase inhibition rather than simple low template.
- **Elevated baseline/smear and occasional small peaks** on TapeStation/Bioanalyzer, consistent with mixed species plus inhibition/precipitate effects.
- **Sometimes improved by repeating cleanup**, which is exactly what you’d expect if inhibitor carryover is the primary failure mode (but inconsistent removal leads to inconsistent rescue).

2) Secondary contributors that often co-occur with the above:
- **Suboptimal bead cleanup execution** (incorrect bead ratio, inadequate ethanol wash removal, under-drying or over-drying beads, bead carryover).
- **Incomplete separation/transfer** (dragging beads or residual wash into eluate), which can also create smear/quant problems.

### Next steps to confirm (no new wet-lab required)
- **Audit run notes vs outcomes**: correlate failures with (i) bead dry time, (ii) ethanol aspiration technique, (iii) whether tubes were briefly spun before the final magnet step, (iv) bead ratio used.
- **Inspect qPCR amplification curves** (not just Ct): inhibited reactions show flattened/abnormal exponential phase and replicate divergence.
- **Compare TapeStation smear severity vs any recorded A260/230** and vs qPCR behavior (should co-vary if inhibitor carryover is causal).

### Fix (protocol + execution)
- Add explicit cleanup “hard requirements” to the protocol:
  - Two 70% ethanol washes; **complete removal each time**.
  - **Defined drying window** (e.g., beads “glossy but not cracked”); do not elute with visible ethanol remaining.
  - **Optional quick-spin** after final wash, then return to magnet to collect residual ethanol at bottom for removal.
  - Transfer eluate to a **fresh tube** after elution to avoid bead carryover.
- Add **QC gates**:
  - If A260/230 is low at any intermediate point (when measured), repeat cleanup *before* proceeding.
  - If qPCR replicate Ct variance is high or efficiency is poor, suspect inhibition → repeat cleanup with stricter ethanol removal.

---

## 1-2. Incident B (operator-dependent PCR success)
### Most likely root cause(s)
**Residual ethanol carryover from SPRI/bead cleanup is inhibiting PCR**, supported by the key observation:
- **Extended bead air-dry + careful removal of residual ethanol restores normal amplification** without changing reagents.

This is operator-sensitive because small differences in pipetting/aspiration angle, patience during drying, and attention to droplets on tube walls can create large differences in residual ethanol.

### Next steps to confirm (no new wet-lab required)
- **Operator-by-operator procedural audit**: compare how each person performs the ethanol wash removal and drying (timing + technique).
- **Check whether “failed PCR” libraries look otherwise plausible in size when they do amplify** (already observed), which is consistent with inhibition rather than missing adapters/primers.

### Fix (make the protocol robust to operator variability)
- Add a **standardized cleanup checklist** (must-do steps):
  1) After final ethanol wash, remove supernatant, then use a fine tip to remove **residual droplets** near beads/tube wall while on magnet.
  2) Air-dry within a **specified window** (e.g., 60–120 s; environment-dependent); proceed only when no visible ethanol remains.
  3) (Optional but robust) quick-spin 5–10 s, back to magnet, remove any collected ethanol.
- Add a **training/competency step**: first run for new operators must include a second-person verification of bead dryness and ethanol removal.

---

## 1-3. Incident C (oversized footprints, weak/absent 3-nt periodicity)
### Most likely root cause(s)
1) **Under-digestion / incomplete nuclease digestion** leading to a broad protected-fragment distribution including **>40 nt** material.
2) **Overly broad size selection** (gel cut too wide), allowing long fragments to enter the library.
3) Possible inclusion of **disomes/polysomes** (longer protected fragments), which dilutes canonical monosome footprints and reduces apparent periodicity.
4) The weak periodicity and increased outside-CDS mapping are expected *downstream consequences* of mixed fragment populations and non-footprint contamination.

### Next steps to confirm (computational + protocol forensics; no new wet-lab required)
- From sequencing data: **compute read-length distribution after trimming**. Confirm whether a large fraction of reads are >35–40 nt (supports under-digestion or wide size selection).
- **Stratify periodicity by read length**: if any periodicity exists, it is usually strongest in the canonical footprint length class; long classes often destroy the signal.
- Review protocol adherence for digestion/selection:
  - enzyme units used, incubation time/temperature, mixing during digestion,
  - exact gel slice boundaries used for footprint extraction.

### Fix
- Tighten digestion and size-selection requirements in the protocol:
  - Specify nuclease dose in **units per µg RNA** and require consistent mixing during digestion.
  - Require a **narrow footprint size window** at selection (define exact nt range and how to locate it with markers).
- Add bioinformatics QC gates:
  - Report read-length histogram; **flag** libraries with substantial mass >40 nt.
  - Apply a length filter (system-dependent, but typically keep a narrow window) and report how much data is discarded.

---

## 1-4. Incident D (UMI dedup collapses almost everything; extremely small UMI diversity)
### Most likely root cause(s)
1) **UMI extraction is configured incorrectly** (wrong UMI start/length), causing the pipeline to extract mostly constant adapter bases as “UMI,” producing near-zero diversity and massive over-collapsing.
2) Alternatively/additionally: **the UMI-containing oligo was not truly randomized** (vendor synthesis/specification issue), producing a small set of UMI strings.

The observation “UMI strings heavily concentrated in a tiny set” is more consistent with (1) incorrect extraction coordinates or (2) wrong oligo, than with natural PCR duplication alone.

### Next steps to confirm (purely computational; no new wet-lab required)
- **Inspect raw read prefixes** (e.g., first 12 bases of R1) and compute per-position base frequencies/entropy:
  - A true random UMI region should have near-uniform A/C/G/T across reads at each UMI position.
  - If bases are constant or highly biased, the extracted region is not a true UMI (or the oligo is defective).
- **Verify that the bases immediately after the presumed UMI match the constant adapter sequence** as defined in `protocol.md`.
  - If they don’t match, UMI position/length is wrong.
- If your demultiplexing produced index reads (I1/I2): confirm the UMI isn’t actually located there.

### Fix
- Update protocol + pipeline together:
  - Add an explicit **read structure diagram** (5’→3’) stating exactly where the UMI resides (R1 vs index; position and length).
  - Provide the exact `umi_tools extract` pattern (or equivalent) in the protocol.
- Add a mandatory **UMI complexity QC** before deduplication:
  - number of unique UMIs,
  - per-position entropy,
  - UMI frequency histogram; fail-fast if diversity is implausibly low.

---

## 1-5. Incident E (ligation failure; short junk products dominate)
### Most likely root cause(s)
**Adapter/linker oligo specification/shipment defect** causing ligation to fail, supported by:
- No band shift immediately after ligation (post-ligation band should migrate slower).
- Final library dominated by short artifacts (adapter/primer dimers) with weak/absent expected library peak.
- Enzyme replacement does not rescue (points away from enzyme deterioration).
- Sequencing: first ~20–30 bases enriched for primer/adapter-like sequence, but **expected linker-specific prefix is rare**.
- Shipment paperwork differs (RNA vs DNA; missing terminal modifications; lower purification grade), matching classic failure when the ligation substrate chemistry is wrong (e.g., wrong molecule type or missing 5’ pre-adenylation / wrong end-blocking).

### Next steps to confirm (no new wet-lab required)
- **Audit the oligo certificate of analysis / shipping paperwork** against what the protocol requires:
  - molecule type (DNA vs RNA),
  - 5’ modification (e.g., pre-adenylated vs phosphorylated/unmodified),
  - 3’ modification (blocked vs free),
  - purification (HPLC/PAGE vs desalted).
- From sequencing data: quantify the fraction of reads that begin with the **expected linker/adapter motif** vs primer-dimer/other artifacts.

### Fix
- In `protocol.md`, make the oligo specification “non-ambiguous”:
  - exact sequence, molecule type, required 5’ and 3’ modifications, purification grade.
- Add a **receiving QC checklist**: do not use oligos until paperwork matches required chemistry.
- Keep the existing post-ligation gel check, but make it a **hard stop**: if no shift, do not proceed to RT/PCR.

## 1-6. Preliminary data analysis (single-transcript pilot)
You provided: `reads.fastq.gz` (400 reads, 50 nt), `reference.fa` (single transcript `toy_gene`), and a processed `trimmed.fastq` containing 400 cleaned reads with UMI in headers (per your data summary). Below is an execution-ready plan to generate the required deliverables and what to interpret from them.

### Coordinate convention (must be stated in outputs)
- **Transcript coordinate system**: 1-based positions along `toy_gene` in `reference.fa`, where position 1 is the **first nucleotide of the reference sequence**.
- **Counted event**: the **5′ end of each aligned read** in transcript coordinates.
  - For reads aligned to the forward strand: 5′ end = `reference_start + 1`.
  - For reads aligned to the reverse strand (if any): 5′ end = `reference_end` (still reported in the same 1-based reference coordinates).

---

### Deliverable A: `counts_raw.csv` and `counts_dedup.csv`
#### Inputs
- `reads.fastq.gz`
- `protocol.md` (to obtain exact UMI length/location and adapter sequences)
- `reference.fa`

#### Processing steps (algorithm level)
1) **UMI extraction**
- Extract the UMI from the correct region (as specified in `protocol.md`) and append it to the read name.
- Output: `umi_extracted.fastq.gz`

2) **Adapter trimming**
- Trim the known adapter(s) from the reads (sequences from `protocol.md`).
- Enforce a minimum post-trim length appropriate for footprints (e.g., 18 nt), but keep this threshold explicit in the report.
- Output: `trimmed.fastq.gz` (you already have `trimmed.fastq`; ensure it matches the protocol’s intended trimming)

3) **Align to `reference.fa`**
- Use a short-read aligner (e.g., Bowtie2 end-to-end) against the single-transcript reference.
- Output: sorted/indexed BAM, e.g. `aligned.sorted.bam`

4) **Generate raw 5′-end counts**
- For each mapped read: compute 5′ end position using the coordinate convention above.
- Count reads per position for all positions 1..L (L = transcript length).
- Output: `counts_raw.csv` with columns:
  - `position` (1..L)
  - `count` (integer)

5) **UMI-aware deduplication**
- Group reads by at least: (**UMI**, **5′ position**, **strand**). (Optionally include read length if your lab defines unique molecules that way.)
- Keep one representative read per group.
- Output: `aligned.dedup.bam`

6) **Generate deduplicated 5′-end counts**
- Same counting as in (4), but using deduplicated alignments.
- Output: `counts_dedup.csv` with the same columns.

#### Notes/limitations
- With only **400 reads total**, some QC metrics (especially periodicity) may be inconclusive even for a good library; the report should explicitly state depth limitations.

---

### Deliverable B: histogram plot of 5′ start positions (raw vs deduplicated)
#### What to plot
- Two panels (side-by-side):
  - Panel 1: histogram/bar plot of `counts_raw.csv` (x=position, y=count)
  - Panel 2: histogram/bar plot of `counts_dedup.csv` (x=position, y=count)
- Use the same x-axis (1..L). Y-axis can be independent (“free y”) so both shapes are visible.

#### What to look for (QC interpretation)
- **If deduplication preserves the overall shape** but reduces counts: consistent with PCR duplicates.
- **If deduplication collapses almost everything** to very few positions: consistent with the Incident D-type issue (UMI extraction wrong or UMI diversity low), or with an extremely bottlenecked library.

---

### Deliverable C: single HTML report (QC + interpretation for this dataset)
Your HTML should be self-contained and include (at minimum):

1) **Inputs**
- File names, read count (400), read length (50 nt raw), transcript length from `reference.fa`.

2) **Read structure verification**
- Show the expected read layout from `protocol.md` (UMI length/location; adapter sequences).
- Report observed frequency of the expected adapter motif(s) in raw reads (sanity check).

3) **Trimming summary**
- Reads before/after trimming, and trimmed length distribution.

4) **Alignment summary**
- Percent mapped to `toy_gene`, mismatch rates (if available), strand distribution.

5) **UMI complexity**
- Number of unique UMIs observed.
- Per-position base composition of UMI (entropy/bias).
- UMI frequency histogram (top UMIs and their counts).

6) **Duplication / deduplication summary**
- Reads pre-dedup vs post-dedup; fraction removed.

7) **5′ start position distribution**
- Embed the histogram/bar plots (raw vs dedup).

8) **Ribo-seq–specific QC (depth permitting)**
- Read-length distribution of aligned reads (post-trim).
- Optional periodicity proxy:
  - If a CDS annotation is available for `toy_gene`, compute frame occupancy of 5′ ends (or inferred P-site after applying a stated offset).
  - If no CDS annotation exists, state explicitly that true periodicity testing is not possible on this toy reference without defining a coding frame.

9) **Limitations**
- Single transcript; low read depth; lack of annotation (if applicable).

---

### Deliverable D: written interpretation + 2–4 follow-up checks/next steps
#### Interpretation (what can be concluded from the provided pilot information)
- The dataset is **technically processable**: files are intact; UMI sequences are present in read headers after trimming; read count is small (400).
- With this depth and a single-transcript reference, **absence of strong 3-nt periodicity would not be definitive** without sufficient reads in the coding region and without an explicit CDS/frame definition.

#### Concrete follow-up checks / next steps (computational, supported by the artifacts)
1) **UMI sanity check (directly targets Incident D risk)**
- Compute UMI per-position base frequencies and entropy from `reads.fastq.gz` (pre-trim) and/or from UMI tags in `trimmed.fastq`.
- If entropy is low or a few UMIs dominate, re-check UMI extraction coordinates against `protocol.md`.

2) **Adapter/linker presence check (targets Incident E-type failure modes)**
- In raw reads, quantify the fraction containing the expected adapter/linker motif(s) from `protocol.md` at the expected locations.
- A very low fraction indicates ligation/library-structure failure even if reads “map.”

3) **Length distribution vs expected footprints (targets Incident C risk)**
- Plot trimmed read lengths and aligned read lengths.
- If a large fraction are >40 nt (given 50 nt raw reads), suspect under-digestion or overly broad size selection.

4) **Raw vs dedup positional shape comparison (targets bottlenecks/inhibition/over-PCR)**
- If deduplication drastically changes the positional distribution (not just scale), suspect technical artifacts (UMI extraction error, bottlenecking, or a small number of true molecules dominating).

---

## Cross-incident validation & prevention plan (applies to the whole workflow)
1) **Make “operator-sensitive” steps explicit in `protocol.md`**
- Bead cleanup: ethanol removal technique + drying window + spin/magnet steps + transfer-to-new-tube rule.

2) **Add hard QC gates with stop/go criteria**
- Post-cleanup: inhibition proxies (A260/230 when available; qPCR curve behavior).
- Post-ligation: required gel shift.
- Post-size selection: footprint size window must be narrow; flag >40 nt contamination.
- Pre-dedup bioinformatics: UMI complexity report must pass before dedup.

3) **Align wet-lab design with bioinformatics assumptions**
- Protocol must include a definitive read-layout diagram and the exact UMI extraction/trimming rules; pipeline must match it.

4) **Receiving inspection for critical oligos**
- Require paperwork/CoA verification of molecule type, modifications, and purification grade before use (prevents reproducible ligation failures like Incident E).

# Red Team Review Feedback
## Reliability Score
- Score: 78
- Rationale: The report demonstrates strong diagnostic reasoning across all incidents, correctly identifying plausible root causes that align with the observations provided. The troubleshooting logic is generally sound and follows standard Ribo-seq failure modes. However, the analysis lacks direct engagement with the actual provided artifacts (protocol.md, reference.fa, reads.fastq.gz), relying instead on generic best practices. The data analysis section (1-6) provides a processing plan rather than executed results, which is a significant gap given that deliverables explicitly required CSV files, plots, and an HTML report. Several recommendations lack specificity regarding the actual protocol text.

## Critiques / Limitations / Risks (in priority order)

1. **Failure to execute the data analysis deliverables (1-6)**: The problem explicitly required `counts_raw.csv`, `counts_dedup.csv`, histogram plots, and an HTML report as deliverables. The answer provides only a methodological plan without actual execution. This is a critical omission—the "written interpretation" section acknowledges the data is "technically processable" but does not demonstrate processing was performed. No actual counts, plots, or QC metrics are presented.

2. **No direct reference to protocol.md content**: Throughout all incident analyses, the report refers generically to "the protocol" without citing specific sections, step numbers, or text from the provided `protocol.md`. This undermines the constraint that "core answers must be supported by the protocol text." For example, Incident E discusses oligo specifications but does not verify what `protocol.md` actually specifies versus what would be correct.

3. **UMI structure not verified against actual data**: The report discusses UMI extraction issues (Incident D) and proposes entropy checks, but does not examine the actual read structure in `reads.fastq.gz` or `trimmed.fastq` to confirm where UMIs are located, their length, or their diversity. The claim that "UMI sequences are present in read headers after trimming" appears to reference provided summary information rather than independent verification.

4. **Coordinate convention stated but not validated**: The report defines a 1-based coordinate system but does not verify this against the reference.fa structure or demonstrate that the toy_gene transcript has defined CDS boundaries. The periodicity analysis is acknowledged as limited but no attempt is made to extract frame information from the reference.

5. **Incident diagnoses rely on pattern-matching rather than differential diagnosis**: While the proposed root causes are reasonable, alternative explanations are not systematically ruled out. For example, Incident A could involve degraded input RNA (not just carryover contamination), but this is dismissed without explicit reasoning. Incident C's "under-digestion" conclusion does not consider whether the protocol specifies digestion conditions that could be audited.

6. **Recommendations lack protocol-specific implementation details**: Fixes such as "add explicit cleanup hard requirements" or "tighten digestion requirements" are generic. Without knowing what the current protocol.md states, it is unclear whether these are additions, modifications, or already present but poorly followed.

7. **No quantitative thresholds provided for QC gates**: The report proposes QC checkpoints (e.g., "UMI complexity must pass") but does not define pass/fail criteria. What constitutes "implausibly low" UMI diversity? What A260/230 threshold triggers re-cleanup? These omissions reduce actionability.

8. **Assumption that all incidents are independent**: The cross-incident validation section treats issues separately, but some incidents may share upstream causes (e.g., Incidents A and B both involve cleanup issues). A more integrated root-cause analysis could identify whether a single protocol defect underlies multiple failure modes.

## Final Short Summary to Attach

The report provides competent diagnostic reasoning for all five incidents, identifying plausible root causes consistent with standard Ribo-seq failure modes. However, it fails to deliver the required computational outputs (CSV files, plots, HTML report) for section 1-6, instead providing only a processing plan. The analysis does not directly engage with the provided artifacts (protocol.md text, actual read sequences, reference structure), relying on generic troubleshooting frameworks rather than artifact-specific evidence. Recommendations are reasonable but lack specificity regarding the actual protocol content and quantitative QC thresholds. The report would benefit from explicit verification of claims against the provided data and protocol text.
