  "original_problem_text": "Problem 1. [Troubleshooting an Ribosome Profiling Experiment]\nYou are given a ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) wet-lab protocol and a set of incident reports from teams who attempted the workflow. Your job is to diagnose the root causes, propose fixes, and design a validation and prevention plan.\n\nProvided artifact\n\n-\tprotocol.md: The protocol “as distributed” to teams.\n-\treference.fa: a single transcript reference sequence (toy_gene).\n-\treads.fastq.gz: 50-nt single-end reads (a few hundred total).\n\nConstraints\n\n-\tAssume no ability to run new wet-lab experiments during the competition.\n-\tYou may propose additional experiments/QC as recommendations, but your core answers must be supported by the protocol text and the incident reports below.\n\nBackground (what “good” usually looks like)\nRibo-seq aims to sequence ribosome-protected RNA fragments. Typical success indicators include:\n\n-\tA narrow protected-fragment size distribution after digestion/selection (often ~28–34 nt; may vary by system).\n-\tClear enrichment of coding-region signal and strong 3-nt periodicity in aligned reads.\n-\tA clean final library trace (dominant peak at expected library size, limited adapter/primer-dimer).\n-\tReasonable PCR duplication; if UMIs are present, deduplication should not saturate at extremely small numbers of unique UMIs.\n\nThis protocol also encodes a UMI in the adapter/read structure (random bases denoted by N).\n\nCompetition framing\nThere are several issues across the incidents:\n\n-\tSome are protocol/document defects present in the originally distributed protocol.\n-\tThere are some execution mistakes (not written in the protocol) by the experimenter. Only observations that may be derived from the mistakes are documented.\n\nSub-Problems\n1-1. Incident A\nTask: Based on the report and observations, propose the most likely root cause(s) and the next steps to confirm and fix the issue.\n\nUser report\n\n“We followed the protocol end-to-end, but the final libraries are kind of messy and the yield jumps around between runs. Sometimes we get a decent peak; other times it’s smeary and hard to quantify.”\n\nObservations\n\n-\tTapeStation/Bioanalyzer traces show a main library peak plus elevated baseline/smear and occasional small peaks.\n-\tqPCR-based quantification shows poor amplification efficiency (steeper Ct variance between replicates than expected).\n-\tA260/230 (when measured) is low in some runs, suggesting carryover of salts/solvents.\n-\tRepeating cleanup sometimes improves the trace but not consistently.\n\n1-2. Incident B\nTask: Based on the report and observations, propose the most likely root cause(s) and the next steps to confirm and fix the issue.\n\nUser report\n\n“Same reagents and same protocol, but different people in the lab get different outcomes. PCR is sometimes fine and sometimes barely works. We didn’t intentionally change anything, so we’re not sure what part is sensitive.”\n\nObservations\n\n-\tStrong run-to-run variability depending on operator.\n-\tPCR sometimes fails or needs extra cycles; when it does amplify, size looks plausible.\n-\tRepeat attempt with an extended bead air-dry (and careful removal of residual ethanol) restores normal amplification without changing reagents.\n-\tNo single protocol text change explains why only some operators see the issue.\n\n1-3. Incident C\nTask: Based on the report and observations, propose the most likely root cause(s) and the next steps to confirm and fix the issue.\n\nUser report\n\n“RNA recovery seemed OK, and the library has a peak, but the sequencing results don’t look like our past Ribo-seq runs. The fragments seem bigger than we expected and the usual ‘frame pattern’ isn’t obvious.”\n\nObservations\n\n-\tGel/fragment QC of protected fragments shows a broad distribution with substantial material >40 nt.\n-\tSequencing QC:\n-\tOverall alignment rate is acceptable.\n-\t3-nt periodicity at P-sites is weak/near-absent.\n-\tReads show increased mapping outside CDS compared to prior internal datasets.\n-\tLibrary yield after PCR is not obviously low; final library peak exists but downstream interpretability is poor.\n\n1-4. Incident D\nTask: Based on the report and observations, propose the most likely root cause(s) and the next steps to confirm and fix the issue.\n\nUser report\n\n“The bioinformatics side is giving us strange duplication numbers. After deduplication, it looks like almost everything collapses into a tiny number of molecules, which doesn’t match how much input we started with.”\n\nObservations\n\n-\tAfter UMI extraction, the number of distinct UMIs observed is extremely small.\n-\tDeduplication collapses a large fraction of reads even in moderately sized datasets.\n-\tA histogram of observed UMI strings is heavily concentrated in a tiny set; uniqueness saturates early.\n-\tDownstream quantification across genes is unusually noisy and sensitive to small pipeline changes.\n\n1-5. Incident E\nTask: Based on the report and observations, propose the most likely root cause(s) and the next steps to confirm and fix the issue.\n\nUser report\n\n“We keep getting mostly short junk products instead of a clean library peak. We tried repeating the run and got basically the same outcome. We did make fresh stocks recently, but we didn’t change anything on purpose.”\n\nObservations\n\n-\tA quick denaturing gel check right after the ligation step shows the RNA band at the same position as the pre-ligation control, with no clear shifted product band.\n-\tThe final library trace is dominated by short artifacts; the expected library peak is weak or absent.\n-\tReplacing enzymes (fresh ligase, fresh buffers) does not reliably recover the expected product; the failure is reproducible across repeats.\n-\tInput RNA quality metrics (RIN/TapeStation) look acceptable and similar to runs that worked previously.\n-\tIn failed sequencing runs, the first ~20–30 bases of Read 1 are highly enriched for primer/adapter-like sequence, but the expected linker-specific prefix from the protocol appears at very low frequency.\n-\tThe new oligo shipment paperwork differs from prior orders in at least one of: molecule type (RNA vs DNA), terminal modifications, or purification grade (e.g., HPLC vs desalted).\n1-6. Preliminary data analysis\nYou are given a small pilot Ribo-seq dataset focused on a single transcript. Process the raw FASTQ into a per-position footprint count array and summarize what the data suggests.\n\nExpected deliverables\n\n-\tcounts_raw.csv and counts_dedup.csv: counts per transcript position (state your coordinate convention clearly).\n-\tA histogram plot showing the distribution of 5' start positions across the transcript (raw and deduplicated side-by-side).\n-\tA single HTML report that, for this single-transcript dataset, summarizes basic QC suitable for Ribo-seq and your interpretation.\n-\tA written interpretation: what (if anything) looks biologically meaningful, and 2–4 concrete follow-up checks or next steps.\n",

      "suggested_approach": "1) Connect phenotype to failure mode: broad/long fragments and loss of periodicity commonly indicate under-digestion (wrong RNase amount/time/temp, incorrect buffer/Mg2+), incorrect monosome isolation (polysomes/disomes or free RNA contamination), or incorrect size selection (gel slice too wide/high). Increased non-CDS mapping suggests contamination by non-ribosome-protected fragments (mRNA fragments, rRNA fragments, or total RNA carryover). 2) Protocol audit: identify nuclease digestion conditions, cycloheximide/translation arrest steps (if any), sucrose gradient/cushion steps, and gel extraction/size selection instructions; look for ambiguous gel cut ranges, missing ‘stop digestion’ guidance, or missing digestion QC. 3) Confirmations without new wet-lab: (a) review any available gel images/notes to see where gel slices were cut; (b) compare fragment-size distributions reported vs expected; (c) in sequencing data (if available beyond the toy set), quantify read length distribution, CDS vs UTR mapping fraction, and periodicity metrics per read length. 4) Fixes: tighten digestion SOP (enzyme units per A260, timing, mixing, temperature, quench), require a digestion pilot titration recommendation (as a future experiment), enforce narrow size selection window (with ladder coordinates), and add an analysis-time filter to select canonical footprint lengths before periodicity assessment. 5) Prevention/validation: include acceptance criteria for footprint length distribution and per-length periodicity checks (e.g., run periodicity per read length class).",

      "suggested_approach": "1) Enumerate plausible root causes: (a) UMI not truly random due to oligo synthesis/order error (Ns not randomized, wrong adapter provided, low-complexity UMI), (b) wrong UMI location/length in pipeline (off-by-k trimming, extracting constant adapter bases as ‘UMI’), (c) sequencer/read structure mismatch (UMI actually in Index read but extracted from Read 1), (d) UMI too short relative to depth causing collisions (less likely if ‘extremely small’ distinct set). 2) Computational confirmations: (a) directly inspect raw read prefixes at the expected UMI coordinates; compute per-position base composition and Shannon entropy; (b) plot UMI string frequency distribution and check if top UMIs correspond to adapter motifs; (c) verify that the ‘N’ region in protocol maps to real variable bases in reads; (d) simulate alternative extraction patterns (shifted offsets/lengths) and see if UMI complexity increases. 3) Fixes: update pipeline to use correct pattern (e.g., umi_tools extract --bc-pattern / --bc-pattern2, or custom regex) matching the protocol’s adapter/read schematic; ensure adapter trimming happens after UMI extraction (or with tools that preserve UMI bases); update protocol.md to explicitly state read layout (5'→3'), UMI length, and which read/index contains the UMI. 4) Prevention: add a required ‘UMI complexity QC’ step (entropy threshold, %N, expected uniform base frequencies) and a small preflight script for operators/analysts.",

      "suggested_approach": "1) Failure signature mapping: no post-ligation shift + short artifacts + adapter/primer-like reads strongly implicate adapter/linker not ligating (wrong chemistry or wrong oligo). Enzyme replacement not rescuing supports substrate/specification error over enzyme failure. 2) Protocol audit: determine what the ligated oligo must be (e.g., pre-adenylated 3' adapter for truncated ligase, 5' phosphate requirement, 3' blocking to prevent concatemerization, RNA vs DNA adapter compatibility with ligase used). 3) Confirmations without new experiments: (a) compare ordered oligo specs against protocol requirements (type RNA/DNA, 5'/3' mods, pre-adenylation, phosphorylation, blocking groups, purification grade); (b) in sequencing reads, search for the exact expected linker prefix and quantify its frequency; (c) check whether observed prefixes match a different oligo sequence (e.g., primer-dimer). 4) Fixes: provide corrected oligo ordering language (full sequence + required 5'/3' modifications + purification, e.g., HPLC/PAGE), add a receiving QC checklist (verify vendor sheet fields), and add protocol callouts for ligation-positive control recommendation (future), plus an analysis preflight check that confirms linker motif presence before deep sequencing.",
