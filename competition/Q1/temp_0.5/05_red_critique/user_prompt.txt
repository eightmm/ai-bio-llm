# Problem
Problem 1. [Troubleshooting an Ribosome Profiling Experiment]
You are given a ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) wet-lab protocol and a set of incident reports from teams who attempted the workflow. Your job is to diagnose the root causes, propose fixes, and design a validation and prevention plan.

Provided artifact

-	protocol.md: The protocol “as distributed” to teams.
-	reference.fa: a single transcript reference sequence (toy_gene).
-	reads.fastq.gz: 50-nt single-end reads (a few hundred total).

Constraints

-	Assume no ability to run new wet-lab experiments during the competition.
-	You may propose additional experiments/QC as recommendations, but your core answers must be supported by the protocol text and the incident reports below.

Background (what “good” usually looks like)
Ribo-seq aims to sequence ribosome-protected RNA fragments. Typical success indicators include:

-	A narrow protected-fragment size distribution after digestion/selection (often ~28–34 nt; may vary by system).
-	Clear enrichment of coding-region signal and strong 3-nt periodicity in aligned reads.
-	A clean final library trace (dominant peak at expected library size, limited adapter/primer-dimer).
-	Reasonable PCR duplication; if UMIs are present, deduplication should not saturate at extremely small numbers of unique UMIs.

This protocol also encodes a UMI in the adapter/read structure (random bases denoted by N).

Competition framing
There are several issues across the incidents:

-	Some are protocol/document defects present in the originally distributed protocol.
-	There are some execution mistakes (not written in the protocol) by the experimenter. Only observations that may be derived from the mistakes are documented.

Sub-Problems
1-1. Incident A
Task: Based on the report and observations, propose the most likely root cause(s) and the next steps to confirm and fix the issue.

User report

“We followed the protocol end-to-end, but the final libraries are kind of messy and the yield jumps around between runs. Sometimes we get a decent peak; other times it’s smeary and hard to quantify.”

Observations

-	TapeStation/Bioanalyzer traces show a main library peak plus elevated baseline/smear and occasional small peaks.
-	qPCR-based quantification shows poor amplification efficiency (steeper Ct variance between replicates than expected).
-	A260/230 (when measured) is low in some runs, suggesting carryover of salts/solvents.
-	Repeating cleanup sometimes improves the trace but not consistently.

1-2. Incident B
Task: Based on the report and observations, propose the most likely root cause(s) and the next steps to confirm and fix the issue.

User report

“Same reagents and same protocol, but different people in the lab get different outcomes. PCR is sometimes fine and sometimes barely works. We didn’t intentionally change anything, so we’re not sure what part is sensitive.”

Observations

-	Strong run-to-run variability depending on operator.
-	PCR sometimes fails or needs extra cycles; when it does amplify, size looks plausible.
-	Repeat attempt with an extended bead air-dry (and careful removal of residual ethanol) restores normal amplification without changing reagents.
-	No single protocol text change explains why only some operators see the issue.

1-3. Incident C
Task: Based on the report and observations, propose the most likely root cause(s) and the next steps to confirm and fix the issue.

User report

“RNA recovery seemed OK, and the library has a peak, but the sequencing results don’t look like our past Ribo-seq runs. The fragments seem bigger than we expected and the usual ‘frame pattern’ isn’t obvious.”

Observations

-	Gel/fragment QC of protected fragments shows a broad distribution with substantial material >40 nt.
-	Sequencing QC:
-	Overall alignment rate is acceptable.
-	3-nt periodicity at P-sites is weak/near-absent.
-	Reads show increased mapping outside CDS compared to prior internal datasets.
-	Library yield after PCR is not obviously low; final library peak exists but downstream interpretability is poor.

1-4. Incident D
Task: Based on the report and observations, propose the most likely root cause(s) and the next steps to confirm and fix the issue.

User report

“The bioinformatics side is giving us strange duplication numbers. After deduplication, it looks like almost everything collapses into a tiny number of molecules, which doesn’t match how much input we started with.”

Observations

-	After UMI extraction, the number of distinct UMIs observed is extremely small.
-	Deduplication collapses a large fraction of reads even in moderately sized datasets.
-	A histogram of observed UMI strings is heavily concentrated in a tiny set; uniqueness saturates early.
-	Downstream quantification across genes is unusually noisy and sensitive to small pipeline changes.

1-5. Incident E
Task: Based on the report and observations, propose the most likely root cause(s) and the next steps to confirm and fix the issue.

User report

“We keep getting mostly short junk products instead of a clean library peak. We tried repeating the run and got basically the same outcome. We did make fresh stocks recently, but we didn’t change anything on purpose.”

Observations

-	A quick denaturing gel check right after the ligation step shows the RNA band at the same position as the pre-ligation control, with no clear shifted product band.
-	The final library trace is dominated by short artifacts; the expected library peak is weak or absent.
-	Replacing enzymes (fresh ligase, fresh buffers) does not reliably recover the expected product; the failure is reproducible across repeats.
-	Input RNA quality metrics (RIN/TapeStation) look acceptable and similar to runs that worked previously.
-	In failed sequencing runs, the first ~20–30 bases of Read 1 are highly enriched for primer/adapter-like sequence, but the expected linker-specific prefix from the protocol appears at very low frequency.
-	The new oligo shipment paperwork differs from prior orders in at least one of: molecule type (RNA vs DNA), terminal modifications, or purification grade (e.g., HPLC vs desalted).
1-6. Preliminary data analysis
You are given a small pilot Ribo-seq dataset focused on a single transcript. Process the raw FASTQ into a per-position footprint count array and summarize what the data suggests.

Expected deliverables

-	counts_raw.csv and counts_dedup.csv: counts per transcript position (state your coordinate convention clearly).
-	A histogram plot showing the distribution of 5' start positions across the transcript (raw and deduplicated side-by-side).
-	A single HTML report that, for this single-transcript dataset, summarizes basic QC suitable for Ribo-seq and your interpretation.
-	A written interpretation: what (if anything) looks biologically meaningful, and 2–4 concrete follow-up checks or next steps.

# Completed Answer
## 1-1. Incident A — Messy library traces, variable yield, poor qPCR efficiency

### Most likely root cause(s)
1. **Carryover of cleanup reagents (ethanol and/or salts/chaotropes) from bead-based purifications** into the final library or intermediate products.  
   *Support from observations:* low **A260/230** in some runs (classic signature of salt/solvent carryover), poor/variable qPCR efficiency, and traces showing elevated baseline/smear that sometimes (but not always) improves after repeating cleanup.
2. **Inconsistent cleanup execution across runs** (even by the same team) producing variable inhibitor carryover and variable library integrity (smear + occasional small peaks consistent with partial products/adapter artifacts).

### Next steps to confirm (no new wet-lab experiments required)
1. **Correlate existing QC metrics across runs**:
   - Plot/compare: A260/230 vs qPCR Ct (and Ct variance) vs TapeStation “baseline/smear” severity.
   - If low A260/230 tracks with worse qPCR and messier traces, inhibitor carryover is strongly supported.
2. **Audit run notes for cleanup handling differences** (even small ones): bead drying time, ethanol removal thoroughness, elution volume, bead pellet disturbance, and whether beads were equilibrated to room temp.
3. **Look for inhibitor-like qPCR signatures** in existing qPCR amplification curves: delayed amplification, shallow slopes, replicate divergence.

### Fix (protocol + execution)
1. **Make bead cleanup steps objective and “operator-proof”**:
   - Require **two 80% ethanol washes** with defined volumes.
   - Add a **mandatory pellet-drying criterion** (e.g., “dry 4–6 min until pellet is matte; no visible droplets; do not elute while wet”).
   - Add a **recommended second aspiration** of residual ethanol (fine tip) while on magnet.
2. **Add a QC gate before proceeding**:
   - If A260/230 is available: require **≥ ~1.8** (or at minimum not “low” relative to successful historical runs).
   - If the trace shows high baseline/smear: perform **one additional cleanup** and re-check.
3. **Standardize documentation**: record bead lot, ethanol freshness, drying time, and elution time/volume.

---

## 1-2. Incident B — Operator-dependent PCR success; extended bead air-dry rescues

### Most likely root cause(s)
1. **Residual ethanol in bead eluates due to insufficient air-drying and/or incomplete ethanol removal**, which inhibits PCR.  
   *Support from observations:* Simply extending bead air-dry and carefully removing residual ethanol restores normal amplification without changing reagents.

### Next steps to confirm (using existing information)
1. **Operator-by-operator comparison** of outcomes vs recorded (or recalled) bead-handling habits: drying time, aspiration technique, whether residual droplets were checked/removed.
2. **Check whether failures cluster at steps immediately following bead cleanups** (post-ligation, post-RT, post-PCR cleanup)—i.e., consistent with inhibitor carryover rather than random reagent failure.

### Fix (prevention)
1. **Add explicit “critical step” language** in the protocol wherever beads are used:
   - “After ethanol wash: remove all visible ethanol; air-dry 4–6 min until matte; only then elute.”
2. **Add a simple operator checklist** (must be filled each run): drying time (minutes), pellet appearance (wet/shiny vs matte), whether a second aspiration was performed.
3. **Training/standardization**: brief hands-on calibration so all operators recognize “matte pellet” and avoid eluting too early.

---

## 1-3. Incident C — Footprints larger than expected; weak/absent 3-nt periodicity; more non-CDS mapping

### Most likely root cause(s)
1. **Incomplete/ineffective nuclease digestion** (e.g., RNase I under-digestion), producing longer protected fragments (including >40 nt) and diluting canonical monosome footprints.  
   *Support from observations:* broad fragment distribution with substantial >40 nt; weak periodicity; increased mapping outside CDS.
2. **Over-broad or incorrect size selection** that allows long fragments into the library (captures heterogeneous RNP fragments, disomes, partially digested RNAs), reducing interpretability even if the library “peaks” and yield is acceptable.

### Next steps to confirm (computational + existing wet-lab QC only)
1. **Length-stratified periodicity check** (from existing sequencing):
   - Compute 3-nt periodicity separately for reads in canonical sizes (e.g., 28–34 nt) vs >35–40 nt.
   - If periodicity is stronger in the shorter subset and absent in longer reads, it supports mixed populations from under-digestion/size-selection.
2. **Length-stratified annotation enrichment**:
   - Compare CDS vs UTR/non-CDS mapping fractions as a function of read length.
   - Enrichment in CDS should be highest for canonical footprint lengths in successful Ribo-seq.
3. **Re-review the gel/fragment QC images**:
   - Confirm whether the excised/selected size window matches the intended footprint window; verify presence of a large >40 nt smear that should have been excluded.

### Fix (protocol changes + recommended future validation)
1. **Add digestion optimization guidance**:
   - Record RNase lot, units used, temperature, and incubation time.
   - Recommend a one-time **RNase titration per new enzyme lot** (even if not feasible during competition, it is the correct preventive control).
2. **Enforce a tight size-selection window** for footprints (whatever the protocol’s intended range is) and add a “stop/go” gate:
   - If >~40 nt material is substantial on gel/trace, **do not proceed** without repeating/adjusting digestion/selection.
3. **Add an intermediate QC acceptance criterion** (pre-library): footprint distribution should be narrow and centered near the expected monosome footprint size for the system.

## 1-4. Incident D — UMI deduplication collapses to tiny number of molecules; UMI diversity extremely low

### Most likely root cause(s)
1. **Bioinformatic UMI extraction is pulling the wrong bases** (wrong read segment / wrong offset / wrong pattern), causing many reads to share the same apparent “UMI” (often a constant adapter segment).  
   *Support from observations:* UMI histogram concentrated in a tiny set; uniqueness saturates early; deduplication collapses most reads; downstream quantification becomes unstable.
2. **Adapter synthesis/procurement issue affecting the UMI region** (degenerate Ns not truly degenerate), leading to genuinely low UMI diversity.  
   *Support from incident framing:* UMI encoded as random Ns in adapter/read structure; low diversity is consistent with a failed degenerate oligo synthesis **or** incorrect UMI parsing.

### Next steps to confirm (using existing FASTQ only)
1. **Directly inspect the raw read sequences at the supposed UMI positions** (first ~50–200 reads is enough):
   - Do the N positions show real base variation?
   - Or do they look constant/adapter-like?
2. **Compute per-position base composition/entropy across extracted UMIs**:
   - True degenerate UMIs should show mixed A/C/G/T at each UMI position.
   - Near-constant bases across positions strongly indicates wrong extraction or non-degenerate synthesis.
3. **Try one or two alternative extraction offsets/patterns** (in silico) and re-check UMI diversity; if diversity “appears” when shifting the extraction window, the original parsing was wrong.
4. **Check the protocol’s read structure description for ambiguity** (common failure: not stating 0-based vs 1-based positions; not stating whether UMI precedes or follows a constant linker).

### Fix (pipeline + protocol)
1. **Protocol must state unambiguously**:
   - Which read contains the UMI (for SE data: Read 1),
   - UMI length,
   - Exact position relative to a constant linker (preferred) or read start,
   - The expected constant flanking sequence(s).
2. **Add a mandatory “UMI sanity-check” report before deduplication**:
   - unique UMI count, top-UMI fraction, per-position base composition/entropy.
3. **Procurement prevention** (if synthesis is the issue): require incoming oligo paperwork to explicitly confirm degenerate bases and correct purification; quarantine new adapter lots until a quick pilot confirms UMI diversity.

---

## 1-5. Incident E — Mostly short junk products; ligation band shift absent; adapter/linker prefix rare in reads; new oligo shipment differs

### Most likely root cause(s)
1. **Adapter oligo is incompatible with the ligation chemistry** due to procurement/spec differences:
   - wrong molecule type (RNA vs DNA),
   - incorrect terminal modifications (missing 5′ phosphate or required pre-adenylation; blocked 3′ end),
   - insufficient purification (high fraction of truncated oligos).  
   *Support from observations:* no ligation shift on denaturing gel; replacing enzymes/buffers doesn’t rescue; sequencing shows primer/adapter-like read starts but the expected linker prefix is rare; paperwork differs in molecule type/modifications/purification.
2. Secondary contributor: **systematic ligation failure leading to PCR amplification of adapter/primer artifacts**, explaining dominant short products and read starts enriched for primer/adapter sequence.

### Next steps to confirm (no new wet-lab experiments required; optional checks noted)
1. **Paperwork/spec audit**: compare old (working) vs new oligo: molecule type, 5′/3′ modifications, purification grade, exact sequence (including Ns).
2. **Sequence-level confirmation from existing FASTQ**:
   - Count how often the protocol-expected linker prefix occurs in Read 1.
   - If it is very low frequency while primer-like prefixes dominate, ligation failure is strongly supported.
3. *(Optional recommendation, if any old adapter stock exists)*: a single test ligation would be definitive, but this is outside the “no new wet-lab” constraint; therefore treat as a recommended post-competition validation.

### Fix (prevention)
1. **Add an “adapter ordering specification block” to the protocol**: explicitly list molecule type, required terminal modifications, and purification grade.
2. **Incoming QC gate for every new oligo lot**:
   - verify paperwork matches requirements,
   - do not release oligo for production use until it passes a quick functional check (recommended future step).
3. **Post-sequencing early-warning QC**: always compute “expected linker prefix rate” on a small pilot before committing to deep sequencing.

## 1-6. Preliminary data analysis — Process FASTQ into per-position footprint counts + QC summary

### Coordinate convention (must be stated)
- Reference: the single transcript in **reference.fa** (id: `toy_gene`).
- **Transcript positions are 1-based** along the reference sequence in its FASTA orientation.
- For each aligned read, we count the **5′ alignment start position** on the transcript (i.e., the leftmost mapped reference coordinate for a forward-strand transcriptome alignment).
- `counts_raw` counts all mapped reads; `counts_dedup` counts mapped reads after UMI deduplication.

---

### Deliverable A — `counts_raw.csv` and `counts_dedup.csv`
Because file upload/execution is not available here, the required deliverables are specified **exactly** as they should be produced from the provided files.

**File format (both CSVs):**
- Columns:
  1. `transcript_id` (string; here always `toy_gene`)
  2. `position_1based` (integer from 1 to transcript_length)
  3. `count` (integer)

**Computation (algorithm-level):**
1. Read and index `reference.fa`.
2. Preprocess `reads.fastq.gz`:
   - Trim 3′ adapter sequence(s) defined in `protocol.md` (or empirically detect the common adapter if the protocol is ambiguous).
   - Remove reads that become too short to align meaningfully (e.g., <15 nt after trimming).
3. Extract UMI according to the protocol’s read structure:
   - Store UMI in read name (or a BAM tag) for downstream deduplication.
4. Align trimmed reads to `reference.fa` (single-transcript reference).
5. For each primary mapped alignment:
   - Let `p = reference_start + 1` (convert 0-based to 1-based).
   - Increment `counts_raw[p] += 1`.
6. Write `counts_raw.csv`.
7. UMI-deduplicate alignments using (alignment position, UMI) grouping (tool choice is flexible; must be deterministic and documented).
8. Recompute counts on the deduplicated BAM in the same way; write `counts_dedup.csv`.

**Minimum QC fields to log alongside counts (in the HTML report):**
- total reads input (given: **400**)
- reads after trimming (given in analysis summary: **400 trimmed reads** were produced in the pilot)
- mapped reads and mapping rate
- raw vs dedup mapped read counts and dedup fraction

---

### Deliverable B — Histogram plot of 5′ start positions (raw vs deduplicated)
**Plot requirement:**
- Side-by-side panels (or overlaid) showing the distribution of `position_1based` counts across `toy_gene`:
  - left: raw (from `counts_raw.csv`)
  - right: deduplicated (from `counts_dedup.csv`)

**Interpretation of the histogram (what to look for):**
- **True positional signal**: localized peaks that remain after deduplication.
- **PCR duplication**: peaks that collapse heavily after deduplication, especially if dominated by few UMIs.
- **Library artifacts**: highly repetitive start sites combined with low UMI diversity (ties to Incident D).

---

### Deliverable C — Single HTML report (QC + interpretation for this single transcript)
The HTML report should include:

1. **Inputs**
   - `reads.fastq.gz`: 50-nt single-end reads (given: **400 reads**)
   - `reference.fa`: single transcript (`toy_gene`)
   - A brief note of assumed adapter and UMI structure (from `protocol.md`) and any ambiguity/assumption made.

2. **Read preprocessing summary**
   - Reads in / reads out after adapter trimming
   - Post-trim length distribution (median, min/max)
   - Fraction with detectable adapter (if measured)

3. **UMI QC (critical given Incident D)**
   - UMI length and extraction rule used
   - Number of unique UMIs
   - Top-10 most frequent UMIs and their fractions
   - Per-position base composition (A/C/G/T) across UMI bases (or entropy summary)

4. **Alignment summary**
   - mapping rate to `toy_gene`
   - mismatch/soft-clip rates (high soft-clipping can indicate residual adapter)

5. **Footprint distribution proxies**
   - (If insert lengths are available post-trimming/alignment) read length histogram
   - 5′ start histogram (raw vs dedup) embedded as an image

6. **3-nt periodicity (limitation-aware)**
   - If CDS coordinates for `toy_gene` are known from the protocol or provided annotation: compute frame distribution of inferred P-site (requires a defined offset and CDS start).
   - **Limitation:** In the provided artifacts list, only `reference.fa` is guaranteed; CDS annotation for `toy_gene` is not explicitly provided here. Therefore, periodicity/frame analysis must be reported as “not computed” unless CDS start/stop are known from `protocol.md` or an accompanying annotation.

---

### Deliverable D — Written interpretation + 2–4 concrete follow-up checks/next steps

#### Interpretation (supported by what is known here)
- This pilot dataset is **very small** (400 reads) and targets **a single transcript**, so biological conclusions (e.g., initiation pausing, stall sites) are intrinsically limited and highly sensitive to duplication and mapping artifacts.
- The most biologically meaningful feature, if present, would be **reproducible positional enrichment** (peaks in 5′ start counts) that **persists after UMI deduplication**, consistent with non-random ribosome occupancy on `toy_gene`.
- The most important technical risk to interpretability in this setup is **UMI failure or mis-extraction** (Incident D pattern), which would cause apparent “signal” that collapses to a tiny number of molecules and makes per-position profiles unstable.

#### Concrete follow-up checks / next steps (2–4)
1. **UMI validation on the raw FASTQ**: confirm base diversity across UMI positions and verify the UMI extraction window matches the protocol’s intended “N” region (rules out Incident D-type failure).
2. **Adapter/linker prefix frequency check**: count how often the expected linker prefix from `protocol.md` occurs at the start of reads; very low frequency would flag ligation/library-structure problems (ties to Incident E).
3. **Length-stratified analysis**: recompute the 5′ start histogram using only reads in the expected footprint length range (e.g., ~28–34 nt after trimming) versus longer reads; mixed sizes dilute true Ribo-seq signal (ties to Incident C).
4. **Raw vs dedup peak persistence**: identify the top start-position peaks in raw counts and quantify how much they survive deduplication; extreme collapse suggests PCR/UMI artifacts rather than true ribosome occupancy.

---

### Assumptions / limitations (explicit)
- No new wet-lab experiments can be run here; all incident diagnoses rely on the incident reports plus existing QC/sequencing observations.
- The exact adapter and UMI layout must be taken from `protocol.md`; if `protocol.md` is ambiguous about positions/offsets, that ambiguity itself is a root cause (especially for Incident D) and must be resolved before trusting deduplication.
- For the single-transcript pilot, **CDS annotation is not guaranteed** from the artifacts list; therefore, 3-nt periodicity and frame assignment are only valid if CDS boundaries (and an agreed P-site offset rule) are available.
