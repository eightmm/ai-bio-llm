  "original_problem_text": "Problem 1. [Troubleshooting an Ribosome Profiling Experiment]\nYou are given a ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) wet-lab protocol and a set of incident reports from teams who attempted the workflow. Your job is to diagnose the root causes, propose fixes, and design a validation and prevention plan.\n\nProvided artifact\n\n-\tprotocol.md: The protocol “as distributed” to teams.\n-\treference.fa: a single transcript reference sequence (toy_gene).\n-\treads.fastq.gz: 50-nt single-end reads (a few hundred total).\n\nConstraints\n\n-\tAssume no ability to run new wet-lab experiments during the competition.\n-\tYou may propose additional experiments/QC as recommendations, but your core answers must be supported by the protocol text and the incident reports below.\n\nBackground (what “good” usually looks like)\nRibo-seq aims to sequence ribosome-protected RNA fragments. Typical success indicators include:\n\n-\tA narrow protected-fragment size distribution after digestion/selection (often ~28–34 nt; may vary by system).\n-\tClear enrichment of coding-region signal and strong 3-nt periodicity in aligned reads.\n-\tA clean final library trace (dominant peak at expected library size, limited adapter/primer-dimer).\n-\tReasonable PCR duplication; if UMIs are present, deduplication should not saturate at extremely small numbers of unique UMIs.\n\nThis protocol also encodes a UMI in the adapter/read structure (random bases denoted by N).\n\nCompetition framing\nThere are several issues across the incidents:\n\n-\tSome are protocol/document defects present in the originally distributed protocol.\n-\tThere are some execution mistakes (not written in the protocol) by the experimenter. Only observations that may be derived from the mistakes are documented.\n\nSub-Problems\n1-1. Incident A\nTask: Based on the report and observations, propose the most likely root cause(s) and the next steps to confirm and fix the issue.\n\nUser report\n\n“We followed the protocol end-to-end, but the final libraries are kind of messy and the yield jumps around between runs. Sometimes we get a decent peak; other times it’s smeary and hard to quantify.”\n\nObservations\n\n-\tTapeStation/Bioanalyzer traces show a main library peak plus elevated baseline/smear and occasional small peaks.\n-\tqPCR-based quantification shows poor amplification efficiency (steeper Ct variance between replicates than expected).\n-\tA260/230 (when measured) is low in some runs, suggesting carryover of salts/solvents.\n-\tRepeating cleanup sometimes improves the trace but not consistently.\n\n1-2. Incident B\nTask: Based on the report and observations, propose the most likely root cause(s) and the next steps to confirm and fix the issue.\n\nUser report\n\n“Same reagents and same protocol, but different people in the lab get different outcomes. PCR is sometimes fine and sometimes barely works. We didn’t intentionally change anything, so we’re not sure what part is sensitive.”\n\nObservations\n\n-\tStrong run-to-run variability depending on operator.\n-\tPCR sometimes fails or needs extra cycles; when it does amplify, size looks plausible.\n-\tRepeat attempt with an extended bead air-dry (and careful removal of residual ethanol) restores normal amplification without changing reagents.\n-\tNo single protocol text change explains why only some operators see the issue.\n\n1-3. Incident C\nTask: Based on the report and observations, propose the most likely root cause(s) and the next steps to confirm and fix the issue.\n\nUser report\n\n“RNA recovery seemed OK, and the library has a peak, but the sequencing results don’t look like our past Ribo-seq runs. The fragments seem bigger than we expected and the usual ‘frame pattern’ isn’t obvious.”\n\nObservations\n\n-\tGel/fragment QC of protected fragments shows a broad distribution with substantial material >40 nt.\n-\tSequencing QC:\n-\tOverall alignment rate is acceptable.\n-\t3-nt periodicity at P-sites is weak/near-absent.\n-\tReads show increased mapping outside CDS compared to prior internal datasets.\n-\tLibrary yield after PCR is not obviously low; final library peak exists but downstream interpretability is poor.\n\n1-4. Incident D\nTask: Based on the report and observations, propose the most likely root cause(s) and the next steps to confirm and fix the issue.\n\nUser report\n\n“The bioinformatics side is giving us strange duplication numbers. After deduplication, it looks like almost everything collapses into a tiny number of molecules, which doesn’t match how much input we started with.”\n\nObservations\n\n-\tAfter UMI extraction, the number of distinct UMIs observed is extremely small.\n-\tDeduplication collapses a large fraction of reads even in moderately sized datasets.\n-\tA histogram of observed UMI strings is heavily concentrated in a tiny set; uniqueness saturates early.\n-\tDownstream quantification across genes is unusually noisy and sensitive to small pipeline changes.\n\n1-5. Incident E\nTask: Based on the report and observations, propose the most likely root cause(s) and the next steps to confirm and fix the issue.\n\nUser report\n\n“We keep getting mostly short junk products instead of a clean library peak. We tried repeating the run and got basically the same outcome. We did make fresh stocks recently, but we didn’t change anything on purpose.”\n\nObservations\n\n-\tA quick denaturing gel check right after the ligation step shows the RNA band at the same position as the pre-ligation control, with no clear shifted product band.\n-\tThe final library trace is dominated by short artifacts; the expected library peak is weak or absent.\n-\tReplacing enzymes (fresh ligase, fresh buffers) does not reliably recover the expected product; the failure is reproducible across repeats.\n-\tInput RNA quality metrics (RIN/TapeStation) look acceptable and similar to runs that worked previously.\n-\tIn failed sequencing runs, the first ~20–30 bases of Read 1 are highly enriched for primer/adapter-like sequence, but the expected linker-specific prefix from the protocol appears at very low frequency.\n-\tThe new oligo shipment paperwork differs from prior orders in at least one of: molecule type (RNA vs DNA), terminal modifications, or purification grade (e.g., HPLC vs desalted).\n1-6. Preliminary data analysis\nYou are given a small pilot Ribo-seq dataset focused on a single transcript. Process the raw FASTQ into a per-position footprint count array and summarize what the data suggests.\n\nExpected deliverables\n\n-\tcounts_raw.csv and counts_dedup.csv: counts per transcript position (state your coordinate convention clearly).\n-\tA histogram plot showing the distribution of 5' start positions across the transcript (raw and deduplicated side-by-side).\n-\tA single HTML report that, for this single-transcript dataset, summarizes basic QC suitable for Ribo-seq and your interpretation.\n-\tA written interpretation: what (if anything) looks biologically meaningful, and 2–4 concrete follow-up checks or next steps.\n",

      "suggested_approach": "Diagnose based on hallmark Ribo-seq signatures:\n- Interpret broad >40 nt protected fragments + weak periodicity as consistent with insufficient/ineffective nuclease digestion and/or inadequate size selection (leading to mixed RNA fragments resembling RNA-seq or partially digested RNP fragments).\n- Also consider monosome isolation issues (disomes/oligomers), altered translation inhibitor usage, or rRNA contamination affecting interpretability.\n- Confirmatory checks using existing data: stratify read QC by length (periodicity often emerges in 28–34 nt); quantify mapping distribution (CDS vs UTR) conditional on length; check whether longer reads preferentially map outside CDS; examine metagene-like frame periodicity if CDS coordinates are known/derivable; check for abnormal length modes (e.g., disome peaks).\n- Protocol review: locate digestion step details (enzyme type, units, temperature, timing, buffer composition, Mg2+, mixing) and size selection instructions (gel excision range; bead-based selection cutoffs). Identify ambiguities likely to yield under-digestion or overly broad selection.\n- Fixes: recommend digestion optimization (titration plan, time-course, enzyme activity handling, RNase inhibitors compatibility), enforce tight size selection window, and include explicit QC gates (protected fragment length distribution must be narrow; periodicity must be detectable in expected length range).\n- Prevention: add a ‘length-distribution and periodicity’ acceptance checklist prior to deep sequencing; require retention of intermediate fragment QC images and digestion conditions in run logs.",

      "suggested_approach": "Separate ‘true low diversity’ from ‘UMI extraction/design failure’:\n- Prioritize explanations that yield a histogram concentrated in a tiny set of UMI strings: (i) wrong UMI parsing/extraction (extracting constant bases instead of the random Ns), (ii) UMI not actually randomized due to oligo synthesis/order error (Ns not synthesized as degeneracy), (iii) UMI length too short or low-complexity, (iv) read structure differs from protocol.\n- Confirmation (computational): directly inspect raw reads at the expected UMI location per protocol.md; compute base composition per UMI position (should be ~uniform); check whether the ‘UMI’ segment matches a constant adapter motif; compare observed UMI length to expected; test alternative extraction regexes; quantify UMI collision rate vs dataset size; verify whether UMI is on Read1 prefix or embedded near adapter.\n- Pipeline fixes: use umi_tools extract with an explicit regex matching the protocol’s N positions; validate extraction by reporting per-position entropy and fraction of Ns; implement safeguards (fail pipeline if UMI diversity below threshold).\n- Wet-lab/design fixes (as recommendations): verify adapter/primer sequences and ordering specs; require incoming oligo QC/spec checks (degenerate positions, modifications, purification); consider moving to longer UMIs if protocol allows.\n- Prevention: add a standardized ‘UMI sanity check’ report section (unique UMI counts, top-UMI fraction, per-position entropy) before deduplication is trusted for quantification.",
