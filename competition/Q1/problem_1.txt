Problem 1. [Troubleshooting an Ribosome Profiling Experiment]
You are given a ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) wet-lab protocol and a set of incident reports from teams who attempted the workflow. Your job is to diagnose the root causes, propose fixes, and design a validation and prevention plan.

Provided artifact

-	protocol.md: The protocol “as distributed” to teams.
-	reference.fa: a single transcript reference sequence (toy_gene).
-	reads.fastq.gz: 50-nt single-end reads (a few hundred total).

Constraints

-	Assume no ability to run new wet-lab experiments during the competition.
-	You may propose additional experiments/QC as recommendations, but your core answers must be supported by the protocol text and the incident reports below.

Background (what “good” usually looks like)
Ribo-seq aims to sequence ribosome-protected RNA fragments. Typical success indicators include:

-	A narrow protected-fragment size distribution after digestion/selection (often ~28–34 nt; may vary by system).
-	Clear enrichment of coding-region signal and strong 3-nt periodicity in aligned reads.
-	A clean final library trace (dominant peak at expected library size, limited adapter/primer-dimer).
-	Reasonable PCR duplication; if UMIs are present, deduplication should not saturate at extremely small numbers of unique UMIs.

This protocol also encodes a UMI in the adapter/read structure (random bases denoted by N).

Competition framing
There are several issues across the incidents:

-	Some are protocol/document defects present in the originally distributed protocol.
-	There are some execution mistakes (not written in the protocol) by the experimenter. Only observations that may be derived from the mistakes are documented.

Sub-Problems
1-1. Incident A
Task: Based on the report and observations, propose the most likely root cause(s) and the next steps to confirm and fix the issue.

User report

“We followed the protocol end-to-end, but the final libraries are kind of messy and the yield jumps around between runs. Sometimes we get a decent peak; other times it’s smeary and hard to quantify.”

Observations

-	TapeStation/Bioanalyzer traces show a main library peak plus elevated baseline/smear and occasional small peaks.
-	qPCR-based quantification shows poor amplification efficiency (steeper Ct variance between replicates than expected).
-	A260/230 (when measured) is low in some runs, suggesting carryover of salts/solvents.
-	Repeating cleanup sometimes improves the trace but not consistently.

1-2. Incident B
Task: Based on the report and observations, propose the most likely root cause(s) and the next steps to confirm and fix the issue.

User report

“Same reagents and same protocol, but different people in the lab get different outcomes. PCR is sometimes fine and sometimes barely works. We didn’t intentionally change anything, so we’re not sure what part is sensitive.”

Observations

-	Strong run-to-run variability depending on operator.
-	PCR sometimes fails or needs extra cycles; when it does amplify, size looks plausible.
-	Repeat attempt with an extended bead air-dry (and careful removal of residual ethanol) restores normal amplification without changing reagents.
-	No single protocol text change explains why only some operators see the issue.

1-3. Incident C
Task: Based on the report and observations, propose the most likely root cause(s) and the next steps to confirm and fix the issue.

User report

“RNA recovery seemed OK, and the library has a peak, but the sequencing results don’t look like our past Ribo-seq runs. The fragments seem bigger than we expected and the usual ‘frame pattern’ isn’t obvious.”

Observations

-	Gel/fragment QC of protected fragments shows a broad distribution with substantial material >40 nt.
-	Sequencing QC:
-	Overall alignment rate is acceptable.
-	3-nt periodicity at P-sites is weak/near-absent.
-	Reads show increased mapping outside CDS compared to prior internal datasets.
-	Library yield after PCR is not obviously low; final library peak exists but downstream interpretability is poor.

1-4. Incident D
Task: Based on the report and observations, propose the most likely root cause(s) and the next steps to confirm and fix the issue.

User report

“The bioinformatics side is giving us strange duplication numbers. After deduplication, it looks like almost everything collapses into a tiny number of molecules, which doesn’t match how much input we started with.”

Observations

-	After UMI extraction, the number of distinct UMIs observed is extremely small.
-	Deduplication collapses a large fraction of reads even in moderately sized datasets.
-	A histogram of observed UMI strings is heavily concentrated in a tiny set; uniqueness saturates early.
-	Downstream quantification across genes is unusually noisy and sensitive to small pipeline changes.

1-5. Incident E
Task: Based on the report and observations, propose the most likely root cause(s) and the next steps to confirm and fix the issue.

User report

“We keep getting mostly short junk products instead of a clean library peak. We tried repeating the run and got basically the same outcome. We did make fresh stocks recently, but we didn’t change anything on purpose.”

Observations

-	A quick denaturing gel check right after the ligation step shows the RNA band at the same position as the pre-ligation control, with no clear shifted product band.
-	The final library trace is dominated by short artifacts; the expected library peak is weak or absent.
-	Replacing enzymes (fresh ligase, fresh buffers) does not reliably recover the expected product; the failure is reproducible across repeats.
-	Input RNA quality metrics (RIN/TapeStation) look acceptable and similar to runs that worked previously.
-	In failed sequencing runs, the first ~20–30 bases of Read 1 are highly enriched for primer/adapter-like sequence, but the expected linker-specific prefix from the protocol appears at very low frequency.
-	The new oligo shipment paperwork differs from prior orders in at least one of: molecule type (RNA vs DNA), terminal modifications, or purification grade (e.g., HPLC vs desalted).
1-6. Preliminary data analysis
You are given a small pilot Ribo-seq dataset focused on a single transcript. Process the raw FASTQ into a per-position footprint count array and summarize what the data suggests.

Expected deliverables

-	counts_raw.csv and counts_dedup.csv: counts per transcript position (state your coordinate convention clearly).
-	A histogram plot showing the distribution of 5' start positions across the transcript (raw and deduplicated side-by-side).
-	A single HTML report that, for this single-transcript dataset, summarizes basic QC suitable for Ribo-seq and your interpretation.
-	A written interpretation: what (if anything) looks biologically meaningful, and 2–4 concrete follow-up checks or next steps.
