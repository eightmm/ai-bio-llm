# Problem
Problem 1. [Troubleshooting an Ribosome Profiling Experiment]
You are given a ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) wet-lab protocol and a set of incident reports from teams who attempted the workflow. Your job is to diagnose the root causes, propose fixes, and design a validation and prevention plan.

Provided artifact

-	protocol.md: The protocol “as distributed” to teams.
-	reference.fa: a single transcript reference sequence (toy_gene).
-	reads.fastq.gz: 50-nt single-end reads (a few hundred total).

Constraints

-	Assume no ability to run new wet-lab experiments during the competition.
-	You may propose additional experiments/QC as recommendations, but your core answers must be supported by the protocol text and the incident reports below.

Background (what “good” usually looks like)
Ribo-seq aims to sequence ribosome-protected RNA fragments. Typical success indicators include:

-	A narrow protected-fragment size distribution after digestion/selection (often ~28–34 nt; may vary by system).
-	Clear enrichment of coding-region signal and strong 3-nt periodicity in aligned reads.
-	A clean final library trace (dominant peak at expected library size, limited adapter/primer-dimer).
-	Reasonable PCR duplication; if UMIs are present, deduplication should not saturate at extremely small numbers of unique UMIs.

This protocol also encodes a UMI in the adapter/read structure (random bases denoted by N).

Competition framing
There are several issues across the incidents:

-	Some are protocol/document defects present in the originally distributed protocol.
-	There are some execution mistakes (not written in the protocol) by the experimenter. Only observations that may be derived from the mistakes are documented.

Sub-Problems
1-1. Incident A
Task: Based on the report and observations, propose the most likely root cause(s) and the next steps to confirm and fix the issue.

User report

“We followed the protocol end-to-end, but the final libraries are kind of messy and the yield jumps around between runs. Sometimes we get a decent peak; other times it’s smeary and hard to quantify.”

Observations

-	TapeStation/Bioanalyzer traces show a main library peak plus elevated baseline/smear and occasional small peaks.
-	qPCR-based quantification shows poor amplification efficiency (steeper Ct variance between replicates than expected).
-	A260/230 (when measured) is low in some runs, suggesting carryover of salts/solvents.
-	Repeating cleanup sometimes improves the trace but not consistently.

1-2. Incident B
Task: Based on the report and observations, propose the most likely root cause(s) and the next steps to confirm and fix the issue.

User report

“Same reagents and same protocol, but different people in the lab get different outcomes. PCR is sometimes fine and sometimes barely works. We didn’t intentionally change anything, so we’re not sure what part is sensitive.”

Observations

-	Strong run-to-run variability depending on operator.
-	PCR sometimes fails or needs extra cycles; when it does amplify, size looks plausible.
-	Repeat attempt with an extended bead air-dry (and careful removal of residual ethanol) restores normal amplification without changing reagents.
-	No single protocol text change explains why only some operators see the issue.

1-3. Incident C
Task: Based on the report and observations, propose the most likely root cause(s) and the next steps to confirm and fix the issue.

User report

“RNA recovery seemed OK, and the library has a peak, but the sequencing results don’t look like our past Ribo-seq runs. The fragments seem bigger than we expected and the usual ‘frame pattern’ isn’t obvious.”

Observations

-	Gel/fragment QC of protected fragments shows a broad distribution with substantial material >40 nt.
-	Sequencing QC:
-	Overall alignment rate is acceptable.
-	3-nt periodicity at P-sites is weak/near-absent.
-	Reads show increased mapping outside CDS compared to prior internal datasets.
-	Library yield after PCR is not obviously low; final library peak exists but downstream interpretability is poor.

1-4. Incident D
Task: Based on the report and observations, propose the most likely root cause(s) and the next steps to confirm and fix the issue.

User report

“The bioinformatics side is giving us strange duplication numbers. After deduplication, it looks like almost everything collapses into a tiny number of molecules, which doesn’t match how much input we started with.”

Observations

-	After UMI extraction, the number of distinct UMIs observed is extremely small.
-	Deduplication collapses a large fraction of reads even in moderately sized datasets.
-	A histogram of observed UMI strings is heavily concentrated in a tiny set; uniqueness saturates early.
-	Downstream quantification across genes is unusually noisy and sensitive to small pipeline changes.

1-5. Incident E
Task: Based on the report and observations, propose the most likely root cause(s) and the next steps to confirm and fix the issue.

User report

“We keep getting mostly short junk products instead of a clean library peak. We tried repeating the run and got basically the same outcome. We did make fresh stocks recently, but we didn’t change anything on purpose.”

Observations

-	A quick denaturing gel check right after the ligation step shows the RNA band at the same position as the pre-ligation control, with no clear shifted product band.
-	The final library trace is dominated by short artifacts; the expected library peak is weak or absent.
-	Replacing enzymes (fresh ligase, fresh buffers) does not reliably recover the expected product; the failure is reproducible across repeats.
-	Input RNA quality metrics (RIN/TapeStation) look acceptable and similar to runs that worked previously.
-	In failed sequencing runs, the first ~20–30 bases of Read 1 are highly enriched for primer/adapter-like sequence, but the expected linker-specific prefix from the protocol appears at very low frequency.
-	The new oligo shipment paperwork differs from prior orders in at least one of: molecule type (RNA vs DNA), terminal modifications, or purification grade (e.g., HPLC vs desalted).
1-6. Preliminary data analysis
You are given a small pilot Ribo-seq dataset focused on a single transcript. Process the raw FASTQ into a per-position footprint count array and summarize what the data suggests.

Expected deliverables

-	counts_raw.csv and counts_dedup.csv: counts per transcript position (state your coordinate convention clearly).
-	A histogram plot showing the distribution of 5' start positions across the transcript (raw and deduplicated side-by-side).
-	A single HTML report that, for this single-transcript dataset, summarizes basic QC suitable for Ribo-seq and your interpretation.
-	A written interpretation: what (if anything) looks biologically meaningful, and 2–4 concrete follow-up checks or next steps.


# Original Answer
## 1-1. Incident A (messy libraries, variable yield, poor qPCR efficiency)

### Most likely root cause(s) (ranked)
1) **Cleanup carryover of inhibitors (salts/solvents/ethanol/guanidinium/phenol)**  
   - Supported by: **low A260/230** in some runs + **poor/variable qPCR efficiency** + **sometimes improved by repeating cleanup**.  
   - Mechanism: PCR and ligations are highly sensitive to trace ethanol/salts; partial carryover can push reactions across an inhibition threshold, producing run-to-run variability.

2) **Incomplete removal of short artifacts (adapter/primer-dimer) and/or inconsistent size selection**  
   - Supported by: **elevated baseline/smear** and **occasional small peaks** on TapeStation/Bioanalyzer; cleanup sometimes helps but not consistently.

3) **Operator variability in bead cleanup technique (over/under-drying; disturbing pellet; residual wash)**  
   - Supported indirectly (and strongly reinforced by Incident B) by “repeating cleanup sometimes improves” and inconsistent yields.

### Next steps to confirm (no new wet-lab required)
1) **Correlate outcomes vs. A260/230 and qPCR replicate variance**
   - Build a run table: {run ID, operator, A260/230, Ct mean, Ct SD, library trace notes}.  
   - Expectation if inhibition is primary: failed/low-yield runs cluster at **low A260/230** and **high Ct SD**.

2) **Re-review electropherograms quantitatively**
   - For each run, record: peak size, peak area, and “smear baseline” (e.g., integrated signal outside main peak).  
   - Expectation if short artifacts are major: “bad” runs show higher low-size signal and/or secondary small peaks.

3) **If sequencing FASTQs exist for “bad” libraries**: check for **overrepresented adapter/primer-only sequences** (FastQC overrepresented sequences; fraction of reads that trim to very short lengths).

### Fix (protocol + execution)
1) **Make cleanup endpoints objective**
   - Specify exact wash ethanol concentration and handling (freshly prepared 80% ethanol; consistent volumes).
   - Add an explicit step to eliminate residual ethanol (e.g., a brief spin and second aspiration of pooled ethanol).

2) **Add a mandatory pre-PCR QC gate**
   - Proceed to PCR only if: (i) A260/230 in an acceptable range (lab-defined; commonly near ~2.0 for clean nucleic acid), and (ii) a test amplification shows normal efficiency / low replicate Ct variance.

3) **Add a “short artifact depletion” decision**
   - If trace shows strong low-size peaks/baseline, require an additional cleanup/size-selection step (method depends on what the distributed protocol uses: bead-ratio tuning or gel cut window tightening).

---

## 1-2. Incident B (operator-dependent PCR success; rescued by extended bead air-dry)

### Most likely root cause(s) (ranked)
1) **Residual ethanol carryover from bead washes inhibiting PCR**  
   - Supported by: PCR success restored by **extended bead air-dry + careful residual ethanol removal** without reagent changes. This pattern is highly characteristic of ethanol inhibition.

2) **Inconsistent bead handling/resuspension and aspiration technique across operators**
   - Supported by: strong operator dependence; no single reagent change explains it.

### Next steps to confirm (no new wet-lab required)
1) **Audit operator technique variables from lab notes**
   - Dry time, whether a second aspiration/spin was performed, whether pellet was disturbed, whether beads appeared cracked/overdried.

2) **Link PCR outcomes to cleanup handling**
   - Expectation: “PCR barely works” runs coincide with short dry time and/or residual ethanol risk behaviors.

### Fix (standardization + training)
1) **Replace ambiguous “air-dry” language with a timed endpoint and visual endpoint**
   - Timed range + “do not proceed if visible liquid remains.”

2) **Add a required “residual ethanol removal” micro-step**
   - Brief spin (or equivalent) + second aspiration of pooled ethanol.

3) **Operator training + checklist**
   - A one-page checklist for bead cleanup (mixing beads thoroughly, aspiration angle/speed consistency, dry-time timer use).

---

## 1-3. Incident C (broad >40 nt fragments; weak/absent 3-nt periodicity; more outside-CDS mapping)

### Most likely root cause(s) (ranked)
1) **Incomplete/inefficient nuclease digestion and/or overly broad footprint size selection**
   - Supported by: protected-fragment QC shows **broad distribution with substantial >40 nt**; downstream shows **weak 3-nt periodicity** (a hallmark of non-canonical footprints and/or mixed fragment populations).

2) **Contamination with non-ribosomal RNA fragments (e.g., non-footprint RNA, partially protected RNP fragments)**
   - Supported by: **increased mapping outside CDS** relative to prior internal datasets, despite acceptable alignment and library yield.

3) **Downstream filtering not restricting to the footprint size window**
   - If long fragments are carried into the final library, periodicity is diluted.

### Next steps to confirm (computational + records)
1) **From sequencing data: compute read-length distribution after adapter trimming**
   - Confirm whether final sequenced inserts are broad and include a substantial tail >35–40 nt.

2) **Periodicity stratified by read length**
   - Compute frame/periodicity metrics separately for canonical lengths (e.g., 28–34 nt) vs longer reads.  
   - Expectation: if digestion/selection is the issue, canonical lengths may show stronger periodicity than long lengths.

3) **Check where “outside-CDS” reads map**
   - If using a transcriptome reference, quantify UTR vs CDS coverage (requires CDS annotation; if absent, infer ORF cautiously—see pilot analysis plan below).  
   - If genome mapping exists, check rRNA/tRNA contamination (if those references were not depleted computationally).

### Fix
1) **Introduce an explicit digestion QC gate**
   - Do not proceed unless the post-digestion fragment distribution is narrow and centered at the expected footprint range.

2) **Tighten size selection**
   - Explicitly define a narrow selection window (gel slice bounds or bead-ratio cutoffs) and require documentation (photo/ladder position notes).

3) **Bioinformatics gating**
   - Analyze and report periodicity by length; optionally restrict quantification to lengths that show strong periodicity.

---

## 1-4. Incident D (UMI dedup collapses to tiny number of molecules; extremely small distinct UMI set)

### Most likely root cause(s) (ranked)
1) **UMI is not truly random in the physical library (oligo synthesis/order/spec problem)**
   - Supported by: UMI histogram **concentrated in a tiny set**; “uniqueness saturates early” even with moderate read counts.

2) **UMI extraction is misconfigured (wrong coordinates/pattern), so a constant adapter motif is being treated as the UMI**
   - Supported by: same symptom (few UMIs) can occur if the pipeline extracts bases from a non-random constant region or extracts after trimming away the real UMI.

3) **UMI base qualities are poor in the UMI cycle range**
   - Can collapse diversity if low-quality cycles create systematic basecalling artifacts (less directly supported by the incident text, but checkable).

### Next steps to confirm (purely computational + paperwork)
1) **Validate read structure vs. protocol**
   - Scan raw FASTQ for expected constant motifs and locate where the UMI bases should be. Confirm the UMI region is actually variable base-by-base.

2) **Per-position base composition and entropy across the UMI window**
   - For each UMI position: %A/%C/%G/%T; a true random UMI should not be dominated by one base at multiple positions.  
   - Compute UMI diversity metrics: number of distinct UMIs and dominance of top-k UMIs.

3) **Verify pipeline order**
   - Ensure UMI extraction occurs **before** any trimming that could remove the UMI.

4) **Check oligo CoA / order form**
   - Confirm the adapter containing “N” bases was ordered as a degenerate UMI, with expected molecule type, modifications, and purification grade.

### Fix
1) **Lock down and verify UMI-containing oligo specifications**
   - Require appropriate purification and explicit “degenerate base region” notation in ordering; verify with CoA.

2) **Add an automated “UMI sanity check” to the pipeline**
   - Fail/flag if distinct UMIs are implausibly few or if top UMIs dominate excessively.

---

## 1-5. Incident E (ligation failure; no gel shift post-ligation; short junk products; new oligo paperwork differs)

### Most likely root cause(s) (ranked)
1) **Adapter/oligo shipment/specification error (wrong molecule type, wrong terminal modifications, wrong purification) causing ligation failure**
   - Supported by: (i) **no shifted band immediately after ligation**, (ii) failure is **reproducible across repeats**, (iii) replacing enzymes/buffers does not reliably fix, and (iv) **new oligo paperwork differs** (RNA vs DNA, terminal modifications, purification).

2) **Wrong adapter sequence/identity leading to libraries dominated by primer/adapter artifacts**
   - Supported by: sequencing shows Read 1 starts enriched for **primer/adapter-like sequence**, while the **expected linker-specific prefix appears at very low frequency**.

### Next steps to confirm
1) **Read-structure audit on failed FASTQs**
   - Quantify fraction of reads containing the expected adapter/linker motif at the expected position(s). Very low frequency supports wrong/missing adapter.

2) **Paperwork diff**
   - Compare old vs new: molecule type (RNA/DNA), 5’ phosphorylation/adenylation state (if relevant), 3’ blocking groups (if relevant), purification grade.

3) **If any remaining old adapter stock exists**
   - (Recommendation) Use it as a positive control in a future run; although new wet-lab is disallowed during the competition, this is the cleanest post-competition confirmation.

### Fix
1) **Add an “incoming oligo acceptance” checklist**
   - Verify identity/specs match the protocol-required chemistry, including molecule type and terminal modifications.

2) **Add a mandatory early ligation QC gate**
   - If post-ligation gel shows no shifted product, stop and troubleshoot oligos before proceeding.

3) **Add a pipeline read-structure gate**
   - If expected linker/adapters are not detected at high frequency in raw reads, flag “likely ligation/oligo identity failure.”

## 1-6. Preliminary data analysis (single-transcript pilot Ribo-seq dataset)

### Scope, assumptions, and limitations
- Inputs: `protocol.md`, `reference.fa` (single transcript), `reads.fastq.gz` (400 single-end 50-nt reads). A `trimmed.fastq` with extracted UMIs is also reported available.
- Limitation: The provided “Data analysis summary” does not include actual alignment/start-position results; therefore **I cannot truthfully print the final numeric arrays here** without executing alignment/counting. Below is an **execution-ready, file-producing procedure** that will generate the required deliverables deterministically from the provided files, plus the QC interpretation framework.

---

### Deliverable A: `counts_raw.csv` and `counts_dedup.csv`

#### Coordinate convention (state clearly)
- Reference: the transcript sequence in `reference.fa`, length = `L`.
- **Transcript positions are 1-based** (first nucleotide of the transcript is position 1).
- For each aligned read, define its footprint position as the **5' end start position on the transcript**:
  - If aligned on the + strand: `start = leftmost aligned position` (1-based).
  - If aligned on the − strand (unlikely for a transcript-only reference, but handle it): `start = rightmost aligned position` (1-based), i.e., the 5' end of the read in transcript coordinates.

#### What to compute
1) **Adapter trimming + length filter**
   - Use the adapter sequences and UMI placement defined in `protocol.md`.
   - Output: trimmed reads (FASTA/Q) retaining inserts typically in the footprint size range.

2) **Align to `reference.fa`**
   - Keep uniquely aligned reads (for a single-transcript toy reference, uniqueness should be high if trimming is correct).

3) **Raw per-position counts (`counts_raw.csv`)**
   - For each transcript position `p = 1..L`:  
     `count_raw[p] = number of aligned reads with 5' start == p`

4) **UMI deduplication**
   - Deduplicate reads using a key that preserves true footprint identity:
     - Recommended dedup key: **(UMI, start_position, read_length, strand)**.
     - Output: deduplicated alignments.

5) **Deduplicated per-position counts (`counts_dedup.csv`)**
   - For each position `p = 1..L`:  
     `count_dedup[p] = number of deduplicated reads with 5' start == p`

#### File formats (required columns)
- `counts_raw.csv`:
  - `transcript_id,position_1based,count_raw`
- `counts_dedup.csv`:
  - `transcript_id,position_1based,count_dedup`

---

### Deliverable B: Histogram plot of 5' start positions (raw vs dedup, side-by-side)

#### What to plot
- X-axis: `position_1based` from 1 to `L`
- Y-axis: counts
- Two panels (or overlaid with clear legend):
  - Panel 1: raw counts (`count_raw[p]`)
  - Panel 2: deduplicated counts (`count_dedup[p]`)

#### Interpretation use
- Spot strong peaks (candidate stall sites / initiation pileups / artifacts).
- Compare whether deduplication removes extreme spikes (PCR duplicates) while preserving the general shape.

---

### Deliverable C: Single HTML report (QC + interpretation for this single transcript)

#### Minimum recommended sections (all computable from given files)
1) **Input summary**
   - Total reads in `reads.fastq.gz` (reported: 400)
   - Read length (reported: 50 nt)
   - Reference transcript length `L` from `reference.fa`

2) **Read-structure validation (critical given Incidents D/E)**
   - Frequency of expected adapter/linker motifs in raw reads (from `protocol.md`)
   - Confirm UMI extraction location yields variable bases (per-position base composition)

3) **Insert length distribution after trimming**
   - Histogram of trimmed read lengths
   - Flag if distribution is broad or shifted away from expected footprint lengths

4) **Alignment metrics**
   - % aligned, % uniquely aligned, mismatch rates (if available)

5) **UMI complexity + duplication**
   - # distinct UMIs observed
   - Dominance of top UMIs (e.g., fraction of reads in top 10 UMIs)
   - Duplication rate: `1 - (dedup_reads / raw_aligned_reads)`

6) **Footprint positional distribution**
   - The raw vs dedup start-position histograms (Deliverable B)
   - Optional: smoothed coverage along transcript

7) **Periodicity / frame signal (with explicit caveat)**
   - If `protocol.md` or `reference.fa` provides CDS boundaries: compute in-CDS frame distribution of starts (or inferred P-site positions).
   - If no annotation is provided: infer a candidate ORF (e.g., first AUG to first in-frame stop) and label results as **heuristic**.

---

### Deliverable D: Written interpretation + 2–4 follow-up checks

#### What looks biologically meaningful (what you can and cannot claim here)
- With a **single transcript** and **only a few hundred reads**, apparent peaks can be driven by:
  - true ribosome pausing,
  - initiation/termination pileups,
  - nuclease/ligation biases,
  - PCR duplication.
- Therefore, treat any single-nucleotide “stall” inference as **tentative** unless:
  - deduplicated peaks remain,
  - peaks align to plausible CDS landmarks (start/stop) with periodicity,
  - read lengths are in a canonical footprint window.

#### 2–4 concrete follow-up checks / next steps (all directly motivated by incidents + this pilot design)
1) **UMI sanity check (Incident D prevention)**
   - Compute UMI diversity/entropy and per-position base composition across the UMI window.
   - If UMIs are dominated by a few sequences, treat deduplicated counts as unreliable until oligo spec + extraction pattern are verified.

2) **Read-structure check for ligation/adapters (Incident E prevention)**
   - Quantify the fraction of reads containing the expected linker/adapters at expected positions.
   - If low, suspect adapter identity/ligation failure or wrong trimming settings.

3) **Length-stratified footprint QC (Incident C link)**
   - Plot start-position distributions and (if applicable) periodicity separately for each trimmed length (or bins like 25–27, 28–34, >35 nt).
   - If only a narrow length bin shows structured signal, restrict downstream analyses to that bin.

4) **PCR inhibition / cleanup proxy checks (Incidents A/B link)**
   - If you have multiple libraries’ FASTQs: compare adapter-dimer rate proxies (fraction of reads trimming to extremely short length) and duplication rates across runs/operators to identify inhibition/cleanup-sensitive batches.

---

## Cross-incident validation & prevention plan (applies to the whole workflow)

1) **Add objective “go/no-go” QC gates at three points**
   - Post-cleanup (A/B): inhibition proxy (A260/230 if available; otherwise qPCR efficiency / Ct replicate variance).
   - Post-ligation (E): gel shift present; raw read-structure contains expected linker at high frequency.
   - Post-sequencing (C/D): trimmed length distribution narrow; UMI complexity plausible; periodicity detectable (where annotation allows).

2) **Standardize operator-sensitive steps**
   - Bead cleanup timing and residual ethanol removal steps must be explicitly defined and checklist-driven (Incident B).

3) **Lock down critical oligos**
   - Maintain a controlled list of adapter sequences, molecule type, terminal modifications, and purification requirements; require paperwork verification on receipt (Incident E) and UMI randomness validation (Incident D).

4) **Automate early bioinformatics “sanity checks”**
   - Before full analysis, automatically report:
     - adapter motif frequency,
     - UMI diversity,
     - trimmed length distribution,
     - raw vs dedup read retention.
   - If any are out-of-family, halt and flag for investigation rather than producing unstable quantification.

# Red Team Review Feedback
## Reliability Score
- Score: 72
- Rationale: The report demonstrates strong domain knowledge and provides logically coherent diagnoses for each incident that align well with the observations. However, the analysis lacks direct engagement with the actual protocol.md content (no specific protocol defects are cited), and the data analysis section (1-6) is entirely procedural without executed results—no actual counts_raw.csv, counts_dedup.csv, histogram, or HTML report are produced. The answer conflates "what should be done" with "what was done," undermining the deliverable requirements. Cross-referencing between incidents is reasonable but occasionally speculative without protocol text evidence.

## Critiques / Limitations / Risks (in priority order)

1. **Failure to deliver required computational outputs (Section 1-6)**: The problem explicitly requires `counts_raw.csv`, `counts_dedup.csv`, a histogram plot, and an HTML report. The answer provides only a procedural outline and admits it "cannot truthfully print the final numeric arrays here without executing alignment/counting." This is a critical gap—the deliverables are not produced, violating explicit task requirements.

2. **No direct citation of protocol.md defects**: The problem states "some are protocol/document defects present in the originally distributed protocol." The answer never quotes or references specific problematic language from protocol.md. All diagnoses are inferred from incident observations alone, leaving the "protocol defect vs. execution mistake" distinction unsubstantiated.

3. **Speculative linkage between incidents without evidence**: Claims such as "Incident B strongly reinforces Incident A" or "Incident D links to Incident E via oligo issues" are plausible but not grounded in explicit cross-incident data or shared operator/batch identifiers. The report assumes correlations that may not exist in the provided artifacts.

4. **Coordinate convention stated but not validated against reference.fa**: The answer specifies 1-based transcript coordinates but does not confirm the actual length L of the reference or verify that the coordinate system matches the reference file format (e.g., 0-based BED vs. 1-based GFF). This could introduce off-by-one errors in reproducibility.

5. **UMI extraction pattern not verified against protocol.md**: The answer discusses UMI extraction extensively but does not confirm the actual UMI position/length from the protocol. If the protocol specifies a different structure, the proposed extraction logic may be incorrect.

6. **Periodicity analysis caveated but not operationalized**: The answer acknowledges that CDS boundaries may not be annotated and proposes heuristic ORF inference, but does not specify how to handle ambiguous cases (e.g., multiple candidate ORFs, non-AUG starts). This leaves the periodicity QC underspecified.

7. **No quantitative thresholds for QC gates**: Recommendations like "A260/230 in an acceptable range" or "UMI complexity plausible" lack operational definitions. Without numeric cutoffs, these gates are not actionable or reproducible.

8. **Assumption of single-strand alignment for transcript reference**: The answer briefly mentions handling minus-strand alignments but assumes this is "unlikely for a transcript-only reference." If the reference contains antisense features or if reads derive from contaminating antisense RNA, this assumption could bias results.

9. **No discussion of read quality filtering**: The answer does not address base quality thresholds for alignment or UMI extraction, which could affect both alignment accuracy and UMI diversity estimates.

10. **Incident E diagnosis relies heavily on paperwork diff**: While the oligo specification mismatch is strongly supported, the answer does not propose a computational check that could be performed on existing FASTQs to distinguish "wrong oligo identity" from "wrong oligo chemistry" (e.g., expected vs. observed adapter sequence alignment).

## Final Short Summary to Attach

The report provides scientifically reasonable diagnoses for all five incidents and a coherent QC framework, but critically fails to produce the required computational deliverables for Section 1-6. Protocol-level defects are not directly cited from protocol.md, weakening the distinction between document errors and execution mistakes. Quantitative thresholds for proposed QC gates are absent, limiting reproducibility. The cross-incident linkages, while plausible, are not rigorously evidenced. Overall, the answer reflects strong conceptual understanding but incomplete execution against the stated requirements.
