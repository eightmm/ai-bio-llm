## Reliability Score
- Score: 72
- Rationale: The answer demonstrates strong conceptual understanding of Ribo-seq troubleshooting and provides systematic diagnoses for each incident with plausible mechanistic explanations. However, several critical weaknesses undermine reliability: (1) the analysis script cannot be validated against actual data since outputs are not shown, (2) protocol.md content is never directly cited despite being a provided artifact, (3) quantitative thresholds are presented as defaults without empirical justification, and (4) some diagnostic claims lack direct evidentiary links to the specific observations provided.

## Critiques / Limitations / Risks (in priority order)

1. **Failure to directly reference protocol.md content**: The problem explicitly provides `protocol.md` as an artifact, yet the answer repeatedly states conditions like "if protocol.md uses non-operational language" or "must match protocol.md" without ever quoting or analyzing the actual protocol text. This is a fundamental gap—protocol defects cannot be identified without examining the protocol itself.

2. **Unverifiable computational deliverables**: Section 1-6 acknowledges inability to access the provided files but presents a script as the solution. The required deliverables (counts_raw.csv, counts_dedup.csv, histogram plot, HTML report) are not actually produced or shown. The script itself has potential issues: exact-match alignment is overly stringent for real data with sequencing errors, and the coordinate convention for reverse-strand reads may not align with standard Ribo-seq conventions (P-site offset is not implemented).

3. **Arbitrary quantitative thresholds without justification**: Thresholds like "linker motif ≥70%", "UMI distinct ≥min(0.2×N, 500)", "top-10 UMIs ≤20%" are presented as operational defaults but lack empirical basis or literature citation. These could mislead users into false confidence or inappropriate flagging.

4. **Incident D diagnosis incomplete**: The answer correctly identifies UMI collapse but does not computationally verify the read structure against the provided reads.fastq.gz. The claim that "UMI extraction is misconfigured" could be directly tested by examining the actual read sequences, which was not done.

5. **Incident E adapter identity check is circular**: The proposed computational check searches for "expected adapter/linker sequence(s) from protocol.md" but if the protocol itself has errors (a stated possibility), this approach would not detect specification errors—only execution errors.

6. **Missing periodicity analysis implementation**: Despite Incident C focusing on weak 3-nt periodicity, the provided script does not implement periodicity calculation. The report mentions "heuristic ORF context" but does not compute frame-specific counts or periodicity metrics, which are central to Ribo-seq QC.

7. **Overgeneralization in cross-incident prevention plan**: The "workflow-wide" validation plan assumes incidents share common failure modes without evidence. For example, linking Incidents A/B/D under "duplication sensitivity" presumes shared etiology that is not established.

8. **No consideration of alternative hypotheses**: For several incidents, only the "most likely" causes are explored. For instance, Incident A's variable yield could also stem from input RNA quantity variation or pipetting errors—alternatives that are not systematically ruled out.

9. **Coordinate convention ambiguity for P-site**: The answer defines 5' start positions but Ribo-seq analysis typically requires P-site assignment with length-dependent offsets. The script uses raw 5' positions without P-site correction, which would weaken any periodicity signal even if implemented.

10. **HTML report lacks critical QC metrics**: The proposed report omits standard Ribo-seq QC elements: metagene profiles, frame preference plots, CDS vs UTR enrichment ratios, and comparison to expected footprint size distributions.

## Final Short Summary to Attach

This response provides a well-organized troubleshooting framework with plausible diagnoses for each incident, but suffers from critical gaps: protocol.md is never directly analyzed despite being a key artifact, computational deliverables are scripts rather than actual outputs, quantitative thresholds lack empirical grounding, and the analysis pipeline omits essential Ribo-seq QC metrics (periodicity calculation, P-site assignment, metagene profiles). The diagnoses are reasonable but remain hypothetical without validation against the provided data files. Score reflects competent conceptual work undermined by incomplete execution of the stated requirements.
