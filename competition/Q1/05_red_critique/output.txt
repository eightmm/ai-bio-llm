## Reliability Score
- Score: 72
- Rationale: The answer demonstrates strong conceptual understanding of Ribo-seq troubleshooting and provides plausible root causes for each incident that align well with the observations. However, critical weaknesses include: (1) the analysis section (1-6) explicitly acknowledges inability to produce required deliverables (counts_raw.csv, counts_dedup.csv, histogram, HTML report) since input files were not examined, making ~25% of the task incomplete; (2) diagnoses rely heavily on general Ribo-seq knowledge rather than evidence extracted from the actual protocol.md document; (3) several claims about "protocol defects" cannot be verified without the protocol text. The troubleshooting logic is sound but insufficiently grounded in the specific artifacts provided.

## Critiques / Limitations / Risks (in priority order)

1. **Failure to execute required computational deliverables (1-6)**: The answer explicitly states it cannot produce counts_raw.csv, counts_dedup.csv, the histogram plot, or the HTML report because "the provided conversation does not include the contents of protocol.md, reference.fa, or reads.fastq.gz." This is a fundamental failure to meet stated requirements. A competing solution that actually processes the FASTQ data would significantly outperform this answer on completeness.

2. **Lack of protocol.md-grounded evidence**: The answer repeatedly suggests certain issues are "protocol/document defects" (e.g., vague cleanup instructions, missing oligo specifications, ambiguous bead drying times) but never quotes or references specific text from protocol.md. Without demonstrating what the protocol actually says, claims about its deficiencies are speculative rather than evidence-based. This undermines the instruction to support answers "by the protocol text."

3. **UMI read structure not empirically determined**: For Incident D and section 1-6, the answer proposes checking UMI extraction parameters but does not actually inspect the FASTQ to determine where random bases appear. The "read-structure manifest" is described procedurally but not instantiated. This leaves a critical gap since incorrect UMI handling is identified as a likely root cause.

4. **Overgeneralization of root causes without differential diagnosis**: For several incidents, the answer proposes the "most likely" cause but does not adequately rank or exclude alternatives using the specific observations. For example, in Incident C, under-digestion and broad size selection are conflated without explaining how to distinguish them computationally from existing data. Similarly, Incident A attributes issues to "carryover contaminants" but the observations (elevated baseline, small peaks) could also indicate incomplete adapter removal or primer-dimer formation—alternatives mentioned but not rigorously excluded.

5. **Coordinate convention stated but offset convention (P-site) deferred**: The answer defines 5′ start coordinates but acknowledges that P-site offset is undefined and periodicity assessment requires CDS annotation. For a single-transcript toy reference, CDS boundaries should be determinable from reference.fa, yet this is not attempted. The practical interpretability of the Ribo-seq data depends critically on this offset, which remains unaddressed.

6. **Follow-up steps are computationally feasible but not executed**: The "2–4 concrete follow-up checks" in section 1-6 are well-reasoned but read as proposals rather than results. This creates a gap between the expected deliverable ("written interpretation" based on processed data) and the actual output (a procedural outline).

7. **Incident E paperwork discrepancy not fully exploited**: The answer correctly identifies oligo specification mismatch as the likely cause but does not specify which modification is most critical for ligation (e.g., pre-adenylation for T4 RNA Ligase 2 truncated, 3′ blocking to prevent self-ligation). A more precise diagnosis would strengthen the root-cause identification.

8. **No quantitative thresholds defined**: While QC gates are proposed (e.g., A260/230 minimum, UMI complexity threshold, periodicity gate), no specific numerical thresholds are provided. This limits the actionability of the prevention plan and makes it difficult to objectively assess pass/fail criteria.

## Final Short Summary to Attach

This review finds the troubleshooting diagnoses for Incidents A–E to be conceptually sound and well-aligned with typical Ribo-seq failure modes. However, the answer is significantly weakened by: (1) complete absence of the required computational deliverables for section 1-6 due to non-examination of input files; (2) claims about protocol defects that are not grounded in quoted protocol text; and (3) insufficient differential diagnosis using the specific observational data provided. The answer would benefit from actually processing the FASTQ/reference files, extracting specific evidence from protocol.md, and providing quantitative QC thresholds. As submitted, approximately one-quarter of the required outputs are missing, and the evidentiary basis for several key claims remains unverified.
