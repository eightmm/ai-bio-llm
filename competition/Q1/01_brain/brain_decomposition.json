  "original_problem_text": "Problem 1. [Troubleshooting an Ribosome Profiling Experiment]\nYou are given a ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) wet-lab protocol and a set of incident reports from teams who attempted the workflow. Your job is to diagnose the root causes, propose fixes, and design a validation and prevention plan.\n\nProvided artifact\n\n-\tprotocol.md: The protocol “as distributed” to teams.\n-\treference.fa: a single transcript reference sequence (toy_gene).\n-\treads.fastq.gz: 50-nt single-end reads (a few hundred total).\n\nConstraints\n\n-\tAssume no ability to run new wet-lab experiments during the competition.\n-\tYou may propose additional experiments/QC as recommendations, but your core answers must be supported by the protocol text and the incident reports below.\n\nBackground (what “good” usually looks like)\nRibo-seq aims to sequence ribosome-protected RNA fragments. Typical success indicators include:\n\n-\tA narrow protected-fragment size distribution after digestion/selection (often ~28–34 nt; may vary by system).\n-\tClear enrichment of coding-region signal and strong 3-nt periodicity in aligned reads.\n-\tA clean final library trace (dominant peak at expected library size, limited adapter/primer-dimer).\n-\tReasonable PCR duplication; if UMIs are present, deduplication should not saturate at extremely small numbers of unique UMIs.\n\nThis protocol also encodes a UMI in the adapter/read structure (random bases denoted by N).\n\nCompetition framing\nThere are several issues across the incidents:\n\n-\tSome are protocol/document defects present in the originally distributed protocol.\n-\tThere are some execution mistakes (not written in the protocol) by the experimenter. Only observations that may be derived from the mistakes are documented.\n\nSub-Problems\n1-1. Incident A\nTask: Based on the report and observations, propose the most likely root cause(s) and the next steps to confirm and fix the issue.\n\nUser report\n\n“We followed the protocol end-to-end, but the final libraries are kind of messy and the yield jumps around between runs. Sometimes we get a decent peak; other times it’s smeary and hard to quantify.”\n\nObservations\n\n-\tTapeStation/Bioanalyzer traces show a main library peak plus elevated baseline/smear and occasional small peaks.\n-\tqPCR-based quantification shows poor amplification efficiency (steeper Ct variance between replicates than expected).\n-\tA260/230 (when measured) is low in some runs, suggesting carryover of salts/solvents.\n-\tRepeating cleanup sometimes improves the trace but not consistently.\n\n1-2. Incident B\nTask: Based on the report and observations, propose the most likely root cause(s) and the next steps to confirm and fix the issue.\n\nUser report\n\n“Same reagents and same protocol, but different people in the lab get different outcomes. PCR is sometimes fine and sometimes barely works. We didn’t intentionally change anything, so we’re not sure what part is sensitive.”\n\nObservations\n\n-\tStrong run-to-run variability depending on operator.\n-\tPCR sometimes fails or needs extra cycles; when it does amplify, size looks plausible.\n-\tRepeat attempt with an extended bead air-dry (and careful removal of residual ethanol) restores normal amplification without changing reagents.\n-\tNo single protocol text change explains why only some operators see the issue.\n\n1-3. Incident C\nTask: Based on the report and observations, propose the most likely root cause(s) and the next steps to confirm and fix the issue.\n\nUser report\n\n“RNA recovery seemed OK, and the library has a peak, but the sequencing results don’t look like our past Ribo-seq runs. The fragments seem bigger than we expected and the usual ‘frame pattern’ isn’t obvious.”\n\nObservations\n\n-\tGel/fragment QC of protected fragments shows a broad distribution with substantial material >40 nt.\n-\tSequencing QC:\n-\tOverall alignment rate is acceptable.\n-\t3-nt periodicity at P-sites is weak/near-absent.\n-\tReads show increased mapping outside CDS compared to prior internal datasets.\n-\tLibrary yield after PCR is not obviously low; final library peak exists but downstream interpretability is poor.\n\n1-4. Incident D\nTask: Based on the report and observations, propose the most likely root cause(s) and the next steps to confirm and fix the issue.\n\nUser report\n\n“The bioinformatics side is giving us strange duplication numbers. After deduplication, it looks like almost everything collapses into a tiny number of molecules, which doesn’t match how much input we started with.”\n\nObservations\n\n-\tAfter UMI extraction, the number of distinct UMIs observed is extremely small.\n-\tDeduplication collapses a large fraction of reads even in moderately sized datasets.\n-\tA histogram of observed UMI strings is heavily concentrated in a tiny set; uniqueness saturates early.\n-\tDownstream quantification across genes is unusually noisy and sensitive to small pipeline changes.\n\n1-5. Incident E\nTask: Based on the report and observations, propose the most likely root cause(s) and the next steps to confirm and fix the issue.\n\nUser report\n\n“We keep getting mostly short junk products instead of a clean library peak. We tried repeating the run and got basically the same outcome. We did make fresh stocks recently, but we didn’t change anything on purpose.”\n\nObservations\n\n-\tA quick denaturing gel check right after the ligation step shows the RNA band at the same position as the pre-ligation control, with no clear shifted product band.\n-\tThe final library trace is dominated by short artifacts; the expected library peak is weak or absent.\n-\tReplacing enzymes (fresh ligase, fresh buffers) does not reliably recover the expected product; the failure is reproducible across repeats.\n-\tInput RNA quality metrics (RIN/TapeStation) look acceptable and similar to runs that worked previously.\n-\tIn failed sequencing runs, the first ~20–30 bases of Read 1 are highly enriched for primer/adapter-like sequence, but the expected linker-specific prefix from the protocol appears at very low frequency.\n-\tThe new oligo shipment paperwork differs from prior orders in at least one of: molecule type (RNA vs DNA), terminal modifications, or purification grade (e.g., HPLC vs desalted).\n1-6. Preliminary data analysis\nYou are given a small pilot Ribo-seq dataset focused on a single transcript. Process the raw FASTQ into a per-position footprint count array and summarize what the data suggests.\n\nExpected deliverables\n\n-\tcounts_raw.csv and counts_dedup.csv: counts per transcript position (state your coordinate convention clearly).\n-\tA histogram plot showing the distribution of 5' start positions across the transcript (raw and deduplicated side-by-side).\n-\tA single HTML report that, for this single-transcript dataset, summarizes basic QC suitable for Ribo-seq and your interpretation.\n-\tA written interpretation: what (if anything) looks biologically meaningful, and 2–4 concrete follow-up checks or next steps.\n",

Recommend confirmatory checks without new wet lab: compare failed vs successful operators’ deviations (pipetting angle, aspiration depth, drying time, resuspension completeness), and inspect qPCR curves for inhibition signatures. Mitigation: add defined air-dry window (e.g., until matte appearance but not cracked), mandatory brief spin + magnet return before final aspiration, optional vacuum centrifuge step with time cap, and an internal spike-in control for PCR inhibition (if already present in existing data). Prevention: operator qualification run using a mock cleanup + qPCR efficiency gate; include photos of correct bead dryness in protocol appendix.",

Build hypotheses: under-digestion (too mild/short/cold; enzyme degraded; inhibitors present) leading to longer fragments and loss of periodicity; contamination by non-ribosomal RNP-protected fragments; overly broad gel cut or misinterpreted ladder leading to >40 nt carryover; mis-annotation of CDS boundaries or wrong P-site offset method (bioinformatics) as a secondary contributor. Confirmatory checks using existing data: plot read length distribution; periodicity stratified by length (periodicity often strongest at ~28–32 nt); CDS vs UTR mapping proportion by length; inspect whether long reads dominate the signal. Fixes: specify digestion titration guidance, enforce a narrow gel cut (document exact nt range and ladder reference), add acceptance gates (e.g., fraction of reads in target length window, length-resolved periodicity score), and include a standardized P-site offset table per read length in analysis SOP.",

Enumerate failure modes: (i) UMI extracted from the wrong position (e.g., offset after trimming), (ii) UMI length mis-specified, (iii) constant bases mistakenly treated as UMI (or vice versa), (iv) low-complexity synthesis or incorrect oligo (too few random bases), (v) read1/read2 confusion if protocol implies different orientation, (vi) PCR jackpotting vs true low UMI diversity (distinguish via pre/post-trim patterns). Confirm with existing data: histogram of observed UMI strings, base composition per UMI position, entropy per position, fraction of UMIs containing ambiguous bases, and whether the ‘UMI region’ matches expected random distribution. Recommended tools: umi_tools extract/dedup (with explicit --bc-pattern and read structure), cutadapt/fastp for adapter trimming with fixed anchoring, and sanity checks by printing the first ~50 reads pre/post extraction. Prevention: add a protocol appendix that explicitly diagrams read structure; add a pipeline unit test that simulates reads with known UMIs; add acceptance gate on UMI complexity (e.g., minimum unique UMI count per 10k reads; per-position entropy threshold).",

RNA vs DNA adapter for specific ligase (e.g., T4 Rnl2 truncated K227Q requires pre-adenylated DNA adapter)), required modifications for directional ligation, and whether the protocol assumes a specific vendor naming convention. Confirm without wet lab: compare the expected linker prefix sequence (from protocol.md) to the observed read-start k-mer enrichment; verify whether the adapter sequence appears anywhere in reads (wrong orientation/complement is common); check for systematic absence of the adapter while primers dominate (consistent with primer-dimer/self-ligation). Recommend fixes: update ordering sheet with explicit sequences + modifications + molecule type; require HPLC purification for adapters with randomers; require certificate of analysis; implement incoming-oligo QC checklist (verify sequence, modifications, mass spec if available) and an in-silico read-structure test (simulate first cycles base composition).
