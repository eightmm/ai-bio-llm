  "original_problem_text": "Problem 1. [Troubleshooting an Ribosome Profiling Experiment]\nYou are given a ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) wet-lab protocol and a set of incident reports from teams who attempted the workflow. Your job is to diagnose the root causes, propose fixes, and design a validation and prevention plan.\n\nProvided artifact\n\n-\tprotocol.md: The protocol “as distributed” to teams.\n-\treference.fa: a single transcript reference sequence (toy_gene).\n-\treads.fastq.gz: 50-nt single-end reads (a few hundred total).\n\nConstraints\n\n-\tAssume no ability to run new wet-lab experiments during the competition.\n-\tYou may propose additional experiments/QC as recommendations, but your core answers must be supported by the protocol text and the incident reports below.\n\nBackground (what “good” usually looks like)\nRibo-seq aims to sequence ribosome-protected RNA fragments. Typical success indicators include:\n\n-\tA narrow protected-fragment size distribution after digestion/selection (often ~28–34 nt; may vary by system).\n-\tClear enrichment of coding-region signal and strong 3-nt periodicity in aligned reads.\n-\tA clean final library trace (dominant peak at expected library size, limited adapter/primer-dimer).\n-\tReasonable PCR duplication; if UMIs are present, deduplication should not saturate at extremely small numbers of unique UMIs.\n\nThis protocol also encodes a UMI in the adapter/read structure (random bases denoted by N).\n\nCompetition framing\nThere are several issues across the incidents:\n\n-\tSome are protocol/document defects present in the originally distributed protocol.\n-\tThere are some execution mistakes (not written in the protocol) by the experimenter. Only observations that may be derived from the mistakes are documented.\n\nSub-Problems\n1-1. Incident A\nTask: Based on the report and observations, propose the most likely root cause(s) and the next steps to confirm and fix the issue.\n\nUser report\n\n“We followed the protocol end-to-end, but the final libraries are kind of messy and the yield jumps around between runs. Sometimes we get a decent peak; other times it’s smeary and hard to quantify.”\n\nObservations\n\n-\tTapeStation/Bioanalyzer traces show a main library peak plus elevated baseline/smear and occasional small peaks.\n-\tqPCR-based quantification shows poor amplification efficiency (steeper Ct variance between replicates than expected).\n-\tA260/230 (when measured) is low in some runs, suggesting carryover of salts/solvents.\n-\tRepeating cleanup sometimes improves the trace but not consistently.\n\n1-2. Incident B\nTask: Based on the report and observations, propose the most likely root cause(s) and the next steps to confirm and fix the issue.\n\nUser report\n\n“Same reagents and same protocol, but different people in the lab get different outcomes. PCR is sometimes fine and sometimes barely works. We didn’t intentionally change anything, so we’re not sure what part is sensitive.”\n\nObservations\n\n-\tStrong run-to-run variability depending on operator.\n-\tPCR sometimes fails or needs extra cycles; when it does amplify, size looks plausible.\n-\tRepeat attempt with an extended bead air-dry (and careful removal of residual ethanol) restores normal amplification without changing reagents.\n-\tNo single protocol text change explains why only some operators see the issue.\n\n1-3. Incident C\nTask: Based on the report and observations, propose the most likely root cause(s) and the next steps to confirm and fix the issue.\n\nUser report\n\n“RNA recovery seemed OK, and the library has a peak, but the sequencing results don’t look like our past Ribo-seq runs. The fragments seem bigger than we expected and the usual ‘frame pattern’ isn’t obvious.”\n\nObservations\n\n-\tGel/fragment QC of protected fragments shows a broad distribution with substantial material >40 nt.\n-\tSequencing QC:\n-\tOverall alignment rate is acceptable.\n-\t3-nt periodicity at P-sites is weak/near-absent.\n-\tReads show increased mapping outside CDS compared to prior internal datasets.\n-\tLibrary yield after PCR is not obviously low; final library peak exists but downstream interpretability is poor.\n\n1-4. Incident D\nTask: Based on the report and observations, propose the most likely root cause(s) and the next steps to confirm and fix the issue.\n\nUser report\n\n“The bioinformatics side is giving us strange duplication numbers. After deduplication, it looks like almost everything collapses into a tiny number of molecules, which doesn’t match how much input we started with.”\n\nObservations\n\n-\tAfter UMI extraction, the number of distinct UMIs observed is extremely small.\n-\tDeduplication collapses a large fraction of reads even in moderately sized datasets.\n-\tA histogram of observed UMI strings is heavily concentrated in a tiny set; uniqueness saturates early.\n-\tDownstream quantification across genes is unusually noisy and sensitive to small pipeline changes.\n\n1-5. Incident E\nTask: Based on the report and observations, propose the most likely root cause(s) and the next steps to confirm and fix the issue.\n\nUser report\n\n“We keep getting mostly short junk products instead of a clean library peak. We tried repeating the run and got basically the same outcome. We did make fresh stocks recently, but we didn’t change anything on purpose.”\n\nObservations\n\n-\tA quick denaturing gel check right after the ligation step shows the RNA band at the same position as the pre-ligation control, with no clear shifted product band.\n-\tThe final library trace is dominated by short artifacts; the expected library peak is weak or absent.\n-\tReplacing enzymes (fresh ligase, fresh buffers) does not reliably recover the expected product; the failure is reproducible across repeats.\n-\tInput RNA quality metrics (RIN/TapeStation) look acceptable and similar to runs that worked previously.\n-\tIn failed sequencing runs, the first ~20–30 bases of Read 1 are highly enriched for primer/adapter-like sequence, but the expected linker-specific prefix from the protocol appears at very low frequency.\n-\tThe new oligo shipment paperwork differs from prior orders in at least one of: molecule type (RNA vs DNA), terminal modifications, or purification grade (e.g., HPLC vs desalted).\n1-6. Preliminary data analysis\nYou are given a small pilot Ribo-seq dataset focused on a single transcript. Process the raw FASTQ into a per-position footprint count array and summarize what the data suggests.\n\nExpected deliverables\n\n-\tcounts_raw.csv and counts_dedup.csv: counts per transcript position (state your coordinate convention clearly).\n-\tA histogram plot showing the distribution of 5' start positions across the transcript (raw and deduplicated side-by-side).\n-\tA single HTML report that, for this single-transcript dataset, summarizes basic QC suitable for Ribo-seq and your interpretation.\n-\tA written interpretation: what (if anything) looks biologically meaningful, and 2–4 concrete follow-up checks or next steps.\n",

Also propose prevention controls to reduce run-to-run variability.",

Map each observation to likely inhibitors (ethanol, guanidinium salts, phenol, high-salt carryover, PEG/bead carryover) and to expected Bioanalyzer signatures (smear/raised baseline, small peaks = adapter/primer-dimer). Recommend confirmatory checks that do not require new wet-lab experiments: review operator notes for bead ratios, wash counts, air-dry timing, elution volumes; re-check A260/230 across intermediate eluates if recorded; examine qPCR amplification curves for inhibition patterns; inspect whether the protocol has ambiguous instructions (e.g., “dry beads” without timing). Propose fixes: standardized bead cleanup parameters (ratios, wash count, mandatory air-dry window), optional second cleanup or size-selection, and an inhibition control (PCR spike-in) plus acceptance criteria for traces. Emphasize prevention: checklist + training + defined hold times and ‘do not overdry’ guidance.",

      "suggested_approach": "Root-cause reasoning anchored on the key clue: improved PCR after extended bead air-dry and ethanol removal strongly implicates ethanol carryover from bead washes (or residual wash buffer) as a PCR inhibitor. Review protocol bead-wash and elution steps for ambiguity: aspiration technique, recommended air-dry duration, residual droplets on tube walls, magnet dwell time, and whether the protocol warns about ethanol inhibition. Confirmation plan: re-examine any available intermediate qPCR data, amplification curves, and notes on bead drying; compare operators’ timing/technique if logged; check whether failures correlate with rushed handling. Fixes: specify a strict ethanol removal SOP (two washes, full supernatant removal, brief spin-down before final aspirate if allowed), define a bounded air-dry window (avoid overdrying), require visual inspection for residual ethanol, and add a small internal PCR control to detect inhibition. Prevention: operator checklist + training, and a ‘stop point’ guidance to avoid leaving beads in ethanol or overdrying.",

Interpret symptoms: overlong fragments and weak periodicity often indicate under-digestion and/or poor size selection; mapping outside CDS can indicate mRNA contamination, run-off ribosomes, or failure to enrich ribosomes/monosomes. Confirm without new experiments by auditing recorded digestion parameters (enzyme lot/concentration, incubation temp/time, mixing), reviewing gel images/excision ranges if available, and computationally checking read-length distributions and periodicity metrics if any sequencing is available from affected runs (e.g., using RiboWaltz/riboSeqR-style periodicity and metagene profiles). Fixes: clarify digestion setup (enzyme units per A260, mixing, quench), tighten fragment size selection window (explicit nt range and gel region), add acceptance criteria (length peak and fraction >40 nt), and recommend future validation: monosome profile (sucrose gradient or equivalent), rRNA contamination assessment, and a small pilot sequencing QC before scaling.",

Review protocol.md for the exact adapter/primer structure and where the UMI Ns are located (5' vs 3' of read, inline vs index). Enumerate failure modes: (i) wrong UMI pattern used in extraction (off-by-k bases; extracting constant adapter bases), (ii) UMI Ns not truly random due to synthesis/ordering error (e.g., ‘N’ replaced by fixed bases), (iii) UMI readout not sequenced (UMI located in read segment that is trimmed away or in the other read/index), (iv) low-complexity UMIs caused by short UMI length or biased base composition, (v) deduplication keyed incorrectly (e.g., collapsing across positions/genes incorrectly). Confirmation steps using existing data: inspect raw read prefixes in reads.fastq.gz; compute per-cycle base composition for the putative UMI region; count unique UMIs vs total reads; examine UMI string histogram and entropy; verify adapter-trimming boundaries. Fixes: update UMI extraction with explicit patterns (e.g., umi_tools extract with regex/pattern matching the documented adapter), ensure adapter trimming order is correct, and deduplicate with appropriate keys (UMI + alignment position/strand as appropriate). Prevention: add a simple “UMI randomness QC” metric to the pipeline and require it to pass thresholds before trusting dedup-based quantification.",

Map failure to likely mis-specified oligos: wrong molecule type (DNA adapter in RNA ligation context), missing 5' phosphate/adenylation, incorrect 3' modification, incompatible terminal chemistry, or inadequate purification leading to truncated products/adapter artifacts. Confirmation plan without new wet-lab: reconcile ordered oligo sequences/modifications against protocol requirements; examine failed-run FASTQ for presence/absence of expected linker prefix, adapter-dimer signatures, and read-start composition; check whether reads predominantly match primer/adapter rather than insert. Fixes: re-order adapters with correct chemistry/purification explicitly specified; update protocol with a procurement checklist and acceptance criteria (vendor, part number, required mods, purification).
