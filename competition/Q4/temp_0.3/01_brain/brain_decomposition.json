  "original_problem_text": "Problem 4. [Identification of Next-Generation Targets and Delivery Strategies to Enhance Antibody Transport Across the Blood–Brain Barrier (BBB)]\n\n\nBackground\nOne of the most significant technological challenges in the treatment of central nervous system (CNS) diseases is the Blood–Brain Barrier (BBB). The BBB severely restricts the entry of large molecules, and as a result, most antibodies and biologic therapeutics fail to achieve effective brain exposure.\nRecent advances have explored strategies such as receptor-mediated transcytosis (RMT) to enhance BBB penetration, leveraging endogenous transport mechanisms. Several targets—most notably Transferrin Receptor (TfR), CD98hc (SLC3A2), and IGF1R—have been extensively studied as BBB shuttle targets. However, these approaches face important limitations related to efficiency, specificity, safety, and translational feasibility.\nIn this problem, you are asked to analyze existing BBB transport strategies and propose next-generation targets and antibody-based delivery approaches that could enable more effective CNS drug delivery.\n\nTask\nBased on existing literature and publicly available data, perform a comparative analysis of established BBB shuttle targets and propose two novel or emerging BBB transport targets or delivery approaches that are most promising for next-generation CNS therapeutics.\n1) Analysis of Established BBB Transport Targets\nAnalyze the mechanisms and characteristics of representative BBB shuttle targets, including:\n•\tTransferrin Receptor (TfR)\n•\tCD98hc (SLC3A2)\n•\tIGF1R\nYour analysis should include:\n•\tBBB transport mechanisms (e.g., receptor-mediated transcytosis)\n•\tReported antibody- or ligand-based shuttle strategies\n•\tKnown limitations, such as:\no\tLimited brain exposure\no\tPeripheral tissue expression and off-target effects\no\tSafety concerns or functional perturbation\no\tChallenges in affinity tuning or format optimization\n\n2) Selection of Next-Generation BBB Transport Targets and Delivery Strategies\nExcluding TfR, IGF1R, and CD98hc, propose two alternative BBB transport targets or approaches that you consider most promising for next-generation CNS drug delivery.\nFor each proposed target, compare it against established targets in terms of:\n•\tEfficiency\no\tExpected increase in brain exposure or CNS delivery efficiency\n•\tSelectivity and Safety\no\tExpression pattern in peripheral tissues\no\tRisk of disrupting endogenous physiological functions\n•\tTranslational Feasibility\no\tNeed for antibody affinity tuning\no\tSpecies cross-reactivity (preclinical to clinical translation)\no\tManufacturability and format complexity\n\n3) Antibody-Based Drug Delivery Strategy Design\nFor the selected targets, propose a drug delivery strategy, considering:\n•\tAntibody shuttle formats\no\tMonospecific vs bispecific antibodies\n•\tBinding affinity strategies\no\tLow-affinity vs high-affinity binding\no\tMonovalent vs bivalent engagement\n•\tPayload considerations (optional)\nClearly explain how your proposed strategy addresses the limitations of existing BBB shuttle approaches.\n \n",

Evaluate candidates using a scoring rubric: endothelial specificity (brain microvascular EC), trafficking suitability (recycling/abluminal release), biology risk (signaling/essential transport), peripheral sink (RBC/platelets/liver/spleen), and species translation (NHP/human alignment). Use public expression/proteomics atlases and brain endothelial scRNA-seq to check specificity; use sequence/epitope conservation analysis for cross-reactivity planning.

Plan affinity/valency tuning experiments (SPR/BLI kinetics; cell uptake/transcytosis assays in human BBB models such as iPSC-derived BMEC transwells; in vivo brain exposure with capillary depletion to distinguish parenchymal delivery). Use in silico structure methods to inform epitope/format decisions (AlphaFold 3 for receptor/binder complex hypotheses; docking and interface assessment; developability screening for liabilities). Define translational strategy (species cross-reactive binder or parallel surrogate generation) and a manufacturability checklist (stability, aggregation, expression yield, heterodimer purity).",
