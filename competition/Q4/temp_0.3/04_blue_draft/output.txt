Problem 4. Identification of Next-Generation Targets and Delivery Strategies to Enhance Antibody Transport Across the Blood–Brain Barrier (BBB)

---

## 1) Analysis of Established BBB Transport Targets

### Common BBB transport mechanism leveraged by antibody shuttles (context)
- **Receptor-mediated transcytosis (RMT)**: (i) luminal binding → (ii) endocytosis (often clathrin-mediated) → (iii) endosomal sorting → (iv) abluminal exocytosis.
- **Key design constraint**: intracellular sorting fate. Strong/bivalent binding can bias trafficking toward **late endosome/lysosome** (degradation/trapping) rather than **recycling/transcytotic routes**, so **affinity, valency, epitope, and pH-dependent dissociation** often determine whether a shuttle is productive.

---

### A. Transferrin Receptor (TfR)
**BBB transport mechanism**
- Endogenous role: iron uptake via transferrin.
- **RMT**: TfR binding at luminal surface, internalization; **pH-dependent dissociation** in endosomes is important for productive trafficking/release.

**Reported antibody/ligand shuttle strategies**
- Early: **bivalent high-affinity anti-TfR IgGs**.
- Evolved best practice: **monovalent, reduced-affinity TfR engagement** (often via **bispecific** constructs that fuse an anti-TfR arm/domain to a therapeutic antibody).
  - Example described in the provided evidence: **trontinemab** uses a **low-affinity (~131 nM) monovalent TfR binding** module to enhance delivery of an anti-amyloid payload.

**Known limitations**
- **Limited brain exposure / sorting penalty**: high-affinity **bivalent** binding can crosslink TfR and promote **lysosomal routing**, reducing true transcytosis efficiency.
- **Peripheral expression / sink & off-targets**: TfR1 is abundant beyond BBB (notably erythroid lineage, liver, GI), creating:
  - peripheral “sink” reducing delivery efficiency
  - risk of perturbing iron handling
- **Safety concerns**: potential disruption of iron homeostasis and erythroid cell biology (especially with chronic/high dosing).
- **Affinity/format optimization challenge**: requires a narrow operating window (affinity/valency/pH dependence) to avoid trapping while maintaining BBB engagement.
- **Translational feasibility**: species cross-reactivity can be difficult; human translation has required specialized approaches (e.g., transgenic/humanized receptor systems in discovery).

---

### B. CD98hc (SLC3A2)
**BBB transport mechanism**
- CD98hc is the heavy chain subunit of heterodimeric amino acid transporters (e.g., LAT1 complex).
- Uses **endocytosis and trafficking compatible with RMT**, but with kinetics distinct from TfR.

**Reported antibody shuttle strategies**
- **Bispecific anti-CD98hc shuttles** delivering full IgG payloads have been reported.
- Notably, unlike TfR, **bivalent engagement has been reported as permissive** in some CD98hc shuttle implementations (i.e., not universally penalized by lysosomal trapping in the same way as TfR).

**Known limitations**
- **Peripheral expression**: broader than ideal (reported in lung, spleen, kidney, GI), creating off-target exposure concerns.
- **Safety/physiology risk**: potential to perturb amino acid transporter function; chronic consequences are **not fully characterized** in the provided evidence (key limitation).
- **Optimization complexity**: affinity-dose relationships appear different from TfR (e.g., affinity can help at tracer doses), which adds design degrees of freedom but also increases empirical optimization needs.
- **Kinetic behavior**: advantage is **prolonged brain retention** (reported sustained levels out to ~21 days post-dose in the provided evidence), which can be beneficial therapeutically but also implies prolonged systemic exposure requiring careful safety evaluation.

---

### C. IGF1R
**BBB transport mechanism**
- IGF1R is a receptor tyrosine kinase; internalization can occur via clathrin and non-clathrin routes.
- Antibody shuttles exploit **IGF1R-mediated internalization/transcytosis**.

**Reported antibody shuttle strategies**
- **Single-domain antibody (VHH)-based IGF1R shuttles** have been reported to deliver active neuropeptide payloads with demonstrated pharmacology in vivo.
- A key reported design feature: an IGF1R-binding epitope **distinct from the endogenous ligand binding site**, reducing risk of agonism/competition.

**Known limitations**
- **Safety/biology risk**: IGF signaling has broad roles (growth/metabolism); even if ligand-competitive effects are minimized, chronic engagement could still carry risk depending on tissue distribution and dosing.
- **Peripheral expression**: present in multiple tissues; off-target exposure is a concern.
- **Translational feasibility**: species cross-reactivity/epitope conservation can be challenging, often requiring surrogate binders across species (as described in the provided evidence).
- **Quantification gap**: while parenchymal delivery is supported, the provided evidence indicates less extensive standardized quantitative benchmarking vs TfR/CD98hc.

## 2) Selection of Next-Generation BBB Transport Targets and Delivery Strategies (excluding TfR, IGF1R, CD98hc)

Selected two most promising (based on the provided evidence summary):  
1. **Neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn)-mediated BBB transcytosis via Fc engineering**  
2. **Basigin (CD147)-targeted RMT (bispecific shuttle)**

### 2.1 Candidate 1: FcRn-mediated BBB transcytosis (Fc-engineered IgG)

**Efficiency (expected CNS delivery)**
- Reported in the provided evidence: Fc variants that increase **neutral pH FcRn binding** can yield **~40–80× improvement in brain:serum ratio** (relative to WT IgG), with some in vitro BBB model reports indicating much larger fold-changes (up to ~150× in that context).
- This directly targets a major limitation of standard IgGs (typically <1% brain penetration), aiming to raise partitioning into a more therapeutically actionable range.

**Selectivity and Safety**
- **Expression pattern**: FcRn is widespread (systemic endothelium and other tissues). Therefore:
  - BBB selectivity is not driven by receptor localization alone.
  - Risk is more about **system-wide altered IgG handling/transcytosis and PK** than about a single peripheral “sink” tissue.
- **Physiology disruption risk**: FcRn is central to IgG homeostasis; Fc engineering must avoid excessive perturbation of recycling/half-life.
  - The provided evidence indicates Fc variants can increase BBB transport but may also change clearance; this is a key tradeoff to manage.

**Translational feasibility**
- **Affinity tuning need**: yes, but **at the Fc–FcRn interface**, typically as a manageable variant screening/selection problem rather than dual-arm bispecific balancing.
- **Species cross-reactivity**: strong overall feasibility because FcRn biology is conserved and Fc engineering can be evaluated across rodent and non-human primate systems.
- **Manufacturability/format complexity**: **low**—remains a standard monoclonal antibody architecture (no bispecific assembly required).

---

### 2.2 Candidate 2: Basigin (CD147)-targeted RMT (bispecific BBB shuttle)

**Efficiency (expected CNS delivery)**
- Reported in the provided evidence: proof-of-concept supports BBB transcytosis/internalization; however, **quantitative performance is less mature** than TfR/CD98hc.
- The provided evidence summarizes an estimated **~1–4× improvement** vs non-targeted controls in available datasets, with clear acknowledgment that deeper characterization is needed (knowledge gap).

**Selectivity and Safety**
- **Expression pattern**: basigin is expressed on BBB endothelium and also on immune cells (e.g., monocytes/dendritic cells); peripheral distribution may be **more restricted than TfR** in the sense of not being dominated by erythroid iron-uptake biology.
- **Physiology disruption risk**: basigin supports monocarboxylate transporter (MCT) expression and thus lactate/pyruvate transport. Key risk is **metabolic perturbation** (brain and/or peripheral), but the provided evidence frames this as potentially less directly catastrophic than iron uptake disruption (TfR) while still requiring dedicated chronic safety work.

**Translational feasibility**
- **Need for affinity tuning**: moderate–high because this is a receptor-targeting shuttle and (typically) a **bispecific**; requires balancing:
  - basigin binding (for transport)
  - therapeutic target binding (for efficacy)
- **Species cross-reactivity**: described as favorable (high conservation), supporting preclinical-to-clinical continuity.
- **Manufacturability/format complexity**: moderate because bispecific production/QC is required (heterodimer purity, chain pairing, etc.).

---

### 2.3 Comparison versus established targets (summary)
- **Vs TfR**:
  - FcRn approach avoids TfR-specific liabilities (iron biology, erythroid sink, strict monovalent low-affinity constraint) and can show much larger reported brain:serum ratio gains.
  - Basigin may avoid iron-specific risk but still needs trafficking validation and chronic metabolic/immune safety characterization.
- **Vs CD98hc**:
  - FcRn is simpler to manufacture (no bispecific), but CD98hc has reported long brain retention; FcRn may require more careful PK balancing due to systemic FcRn engagement.
  - Basigin is earlier in maturity than CD98hc in quantitative benchmarking.
- **Vs IGF1R**:
  - FcRn reduces dependence on receptor epitope conservation (engineering is on Fc), generally improving translational workflow.
  - Basigin is reported as more conserved, potentially simplifying translation relative to some IGF1R programs.

**Assumption/limitation (explicit)**
- The provided “data analysis output” indicates **no additional dataset-driven computation** was performed (“skipped”), so all comparisons here are grounded in the supplied literature-style evidence summary and its reported figures/claims; basigin quantitative performance remains a stated uncertainty.

## 3) Antibody-Based Drug Delivery Strategy Design

Below are execution-ready design strategies for the two selected approaches, including concrete steps, inputs/outputs, metrics, and caveats.

---

### 3.1 Strategy for FcRn-mediated BBB delivery: Fc-engineered monospecific IgG (no added shuttle arm)

**A. Shuttle formats**
- **Monospecific IgG** retained (therapeutic target specificity unchanged).
- BBB delivery enabled by **Fc substitutions** that increase **neutral pH FcRn binding** (per the provided evidence).

**B. Binding affinity strategies**
- Goal: increase FcRn binding at **pH 7.4** sufficiently to drive BBB transcytosis while not overly compromising:
  - pH-dependent recycling behavior
  - systemic half-life (avoid excessive clearance)
- Practical approach: screen a **panel of Fc variants** (e.g., variants described in the provided evidence such as M252Y and M252Y/Q309T) rather than assuming a single “best” mutation set.

**C. Proposed development pipeline (steps, inputs, outputs, metrics)**
1. **Input**: lead therapeutic antibody (IgG) against CNS target (e.g., amyloid/tau/synuclein/neuroinflammation target).
   - **Output**: a small Fc-variant library (WT Fc + multiple engineered Fc versions).
2. **Biophysical/developability screen**
   - **Inputs**: purified Fc-variant IgGs.
   - **Outputs**: stable, manufacturable candidates.
   - **Metrics**: expression yield, SEC aggregation %, thermal stability, general formulation stability.
3. **FcRn binding kinetics screen**
   - **Inputs**: Fc-variant IgGs; FcRn reagents.
   - **Outputs**: rank-ordered variants by FcRn binding at **pH 7.4** and **pH ~5.5–6**.
   - **Metrics**: KD/kon/koff at both pH conditions (method-agnostic: SPR/BLI acceptable).
4. **In vitro BBB transcytosis assay**
   - **Inputs**: human BBB model (e.g., iPSC-derived BMEC transwell), Fc-variants.
   - **Outputs**: transcytosis ranking.
   - **Metrics**:
     - TEER/permeability controls to confirm barrier integrity
     - apical→basolateral flux (percent dose transported; Papp if used)
     - control IgG baseline
5. **In vivo confirmation (rodent ± NHP)**
   - **Inputs**: top Fc-variants; dosing plan.
   - **Outputs**: brain exposure and brain:plasma ratio; PK/PD linkage if target has a measurable biomarker.
   - **Metrics**:
     - brain concentration and **brain:serum ratio**
     - time course (retention)
     - if available: capillary depletion to distinguish vascular vs parenchymal antibody (recommended)
     - target engagement readout (biomarker change consistent with payload mechanism; example provided evidence mentions anti-BACE1 lowering Aβ40)

**D. How this addresses established limitations**
- Avoids **TfR/CD98hc/IGF1R peripheral receptor sink biology** by not requiring an added receptor-targeting binding arm.
- Avoids **bispecific format complexity** (manufacturing and QC simpler).
- Can deliver large improvements in **brain:serum ratio** as reported in the provided evidence (tens-fold), exceeding typical fold-gains cited for many classical RMT shuttles.

**E. Key caveats/limitations**
- FcRn is ubiquitous: variants may increase exposure in other organs and alter systemic PK (shorter half-life for some variants). This must be explicitly optimized, not assumed.
- Because no BBB-unique receptor is targeted, BBB selectivity is an emergent property of endothelial FcRn trafficking and systemic PK—requires careful in vivo confirmation per therapeutic.

### 3.2 Strategy for Basigin (CD147)-targeted BBB delivery: bispecific antibody shuttle

**A. Shuttle formats**
Two practical, manufacturable options (to be evaluated head-to-head):
1. **Bispecific IgG (heterodimeric)**: one arm binds **basigin (CD147)** for BBB transport; the other arm binds the **therapeutic CNS target**.
2. **IgG–scFv fusion format (monovalent basigin binding)**: therapeutic IgG fused to an anti-basigin scFv/domain to enforce **monovalent** basigin engagement (a design pattern used for TfR shuttles in the provided evidence).

**B. Binding affinity strategies**
- Basigin arm:
  - Prioritize an affinity window that supports endocytosis/transcytosis without excessive intracellular trapping; the provided evidence notes that, consistent with RMT principles, **lower affinity can outperform at higher doses**, while higher affinity may help at tracer doses.
  - Therefore, generate a **small affinity panel** (e.g., higher-, medium-, lower-affinity variants) rather than committing upfront to a single affinity.
- Valency:
  - Evaluate **monovalent vs bivalent** basigin engagement empirically (basigin does not yet have the same well-defined “must be monovalent” rule as TfR).
- Optional: screen for **pH-dependent dissociation** (binds at pH 7.4, weaker at endosomal pH) as a potential lever to reduce intracellular trapping; this is a proven lever for TfR in the provided evidence, but **not yet established for basigin** (assumption to be tested, not taken as fact).

**C. Proposed development pipeline (steps, inputs, outputs, metrics)**
1. **Generate basigin-binding panel**
   - **Inputs**: basigin ectodomain and/or basigin-expressing cells.
   - **Outputs**: multiple anti-basigin binders spanning affinity/epitope diversity.
   - **Metrics**: cell-binding EC50; kinetic KD (pH 7.4 ± pH 5.5/6.0 characterization).
2. **Assemble bispecifics (and optionally IgG–scFv fusions)**
   - **Inputs**: anti-basigin candidates + therapeutic arm.
   - **Outputs**: bispecific constructs passing purity/stability thresholds.
   - **Metrics**: heterodimer purity, aggregation %, retained binding of both arms (≤~2-fold loss vs parent antibodies as a practical acceptance criterion).
3. **In vitro BBB transcytosis + trafficking**
   - **Inputs**: human BBB transwell model; labeled antibodies for imaging.
   - **Outputs**: ranked constructs + mechanistic confidence.
   - **Metrics**:
     - apical→basolateral transport vs non-targeted IgG control
     - intracellular localization markers consistent with productive routing (early/recycling vs late/lysosomal compartments), if assessed
4. **In vivo brain exposure confirmation**
   - **Inputs**: top constructs.
   - **Outputs**: brain uptake and evidence of parenchymal delivery.
   - **Metrics**:
     - brain concentration and brain:plasma ratio
     - capillary depletion (recommended) to confirm parenchymal vs vascular association
     - PK time course (does it resemble TfR-like transient uptake or show longer retention?)
5. **Safety focus areas (because basigin biology is not purely “inert”)**
   - **Inputs**: repeat-dose studies in relevant species.
   - **Outputs**: risk characterization.
   - **Metrics**:
     - endpoints related to monocarboxylate transporter-linked metabolism (as feasible)
     - immune cell phenotyping/cytokines (given immune expression noted in the provided evidence)

**D. How this addresses established limitations**
- Potentially reduces **TfR-specific** liabilities (iron pathway perturbation, erythroid sink).
- Compared with TfR’s narrow tuning constraints, basigin may offer a broader workable design space (still to be proven quantitatively).
- Strong species conservation (per provided evidence) can simplify translation relative to targets with poor cross-reactivity.

**E. Key caveats/limitations**
- Quantitative brain-delivery benchmarking is **less mature** than TfR/CD98hc in the provided evidence; a disciplined, data-driven optimization loop is required.
- Chronic effects of basigin engagement on lactate transport/metabolism and immune biology remain incompletely characterized in the provided evidence and must be treated as a central development risk.

---

### 3.3 Payload considerations (optional, applicable to both)
- Both approaches are compatible with:
  - standard IgG therapeutics (neutralizing or agonist/antagonist)
  - Fc-silent or effector-enabled designs depending on CNS target biology
  - fusions (enzymes, cytokines) or other biologic payloads, provided developability/PK remains acceptable
- The primary payload-related constraint is **required brain concentration** for efficacy: targets needing high parenchymal concentrations benefit most from the higher-efficiency approach (FcRn engineering), while targets tolerant of lower exposure or benefiting from specific cellular routing may be compatible with basigin shuttles after optimization.

---

### Final deliverable summary (what to do next)
- **Near-term, highest-confidence next-gen path** (per provided evidence): **FcRn Fc-engineering**, because it is modular, manufacturable, and associated with large reported increases in brain:serum ratios.
- **Second path with strong promise but key knowledge gaps**: **basigin (CD147) RMT bispecific shuttles**, prioritized if peripheral sink avoidance and receptor-targeted delivery are desired, with explicit early investments in trafficking validation and chronic safety de-risking.
