# Next-Generation Blood-Brain Barrier Transport Targets and Antibody Shuttle Design for Enhanced CNS Drug Delivery

The blood-brain barrier (BBB) represents one of the most formidable obstacles to treating central nervous system (CNS) diseases, as it restricts the passage of over 98% of small-molecule drugs and nearly all large therapeutic molecules from reaching brain tissue[9][12]. This selective impermeability, while essential for protecting the brain from systemic toxins, severely limits the therapeutic options available for neurodegenerative diseases, brain tumors, and neuroinflammatory conditions. Recent advances in receptor-mediated transcytosis (RMT) have provided a physiologically-grounded approach to overcome this barrier by engineering antibodies and biologics to engage endothelial receptors that normally facilitate the transport of endogenous ligands across brain microvasculature. While transferrin receptor (TfR), CD98 heavy chain (CD98hc), and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) have emerged as validated BBB transport targets, each approach carries significant limitations regarding efficiency, peripheral tissue expression, off-target toxicity, and translational feasibility. This report provides a comprehensive comparative analysis of these established targets, identifies two promising next-generation BBB transport targets—carbonic anhydrase IV (CA-IV) and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP-1)—and proposes novel antibody-based delivery strategies designed to address the multifaceted limitations of current platforms while advancing clinical translation for CNS therapeutics.

## Comparative Analysis of Established Blood-Brain Barrier Transport Targets

### Transferrin Receptor (TfR1): Mechanism, Performance, and Limitations

The transferrin receptor (TfR), the most extensively studied BBB transport target to date, mediates iron homeostasis through receptor-mediated endocytosis of iron-bound transferrin ligands[20][22][38]. TfR1 is expressed at high levels on brain endothelial cells, where it internalizes at the luminal membrane, traffics through early endosomes, and undergoes sorting for either recycling back to the plasma membrane or advancement toward late endosomal compartments[20][22][38]. This bidirectional cycling makes TfR an attractive target for drug shuttling, as therapeutic agents fused to anti-TfR antibodies can exploit this native trafficking pathway to cross the BBB. The first-generation approach, pioneered by Pardridge and colleagues, utilized anti-TfR antibodies with high affinity for the receptor; however, subsequent studies revealed that excessive binding affinity led to entrapment within acidic endosomal compartments and preferential routing toward lysosomal degradation rather than transcytosis[22][28]. This critical finding prompted the development of affinity-tuned, lower-affinity anti-TfR binders that maintain receptor engagement at physiological pH but undergo pH-dependent release in acidic endosomal environments[25][28]. The rationale is that reduced affinity at endosomal pH (approximately 5.5) facilitates dissociation of the antibody-receptor complex, promoting sorting toward recycling endosomes and abluminal exocytosis rather than lysosomal degradation[25][28].

Monovalent versus bivalent engagement of TfR represents a second critical design parameter. Early bispecific TfR shuttles employed bivalent TfR-binding arms, which can crosslink receptors on the endothelial cell surface, inadvertently promoting receptor clustering and preferential internalization through pathways that favor lysosomal routing[8][11][22]. More recent work has demonstrated that monovalent TfR-binding constructs achieve superior brain penetration by avoiding this crosslinking trap, while maintaining sufficient avidity through slower dissociation kinetics or through combination with extended pharmacokinetic half-lives[8][11]. Studies using bispecific antibody shuttles with one TfR-binding arm and one therapeutic arm (targeting beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme [BACE] or other CNS targets) have reported 55–65% reductions in brain amyloid-beta levels in transgenic Alzheimer's disease models[52]. Notably, clinical validation has emerged with molecules such as Trontinemab (Roche's BrainShuttle anti-amyloid antibody), which demonstrated approximately 91% amyloid-beta clearance at 28 weeks in early-stage Alzheimer's disease patients[32].

However, TfR-based platforms face substantial limitations that constrain their utility for certain applications. First, TfR is highly expressed in peripheral tissues, particularly in rapidly proliferating cells and tissues with high iron demand, creating a significant peripheral tissue sink that reduces the amount of shuttle available for brain delivery[12][45]. Second, systemic anti-TfR therapy raises safety concerns related to iron metabolism disruption, including reported adverse events such as anemia, reticulocytosis, and hemodynamic effects observed in clinical trials of anti-TfR monoclonal antibodies[9][12][45]. Third, the high serum concentration of endogenous transferrin (in the millimolar range) presents substantial competition for TfR binding, potentially reducing the occupancy of synthetic anti-TfR agents at the BBB. Fourth, while affinity tuning has improved transcytosis efficiency, the tight coupling between affinity, pH-dependence, and brain exposure complicates the optimization process, requiring extensive experimentation to balance adequate BBB uptake with sufficient abluminal release[8][11][25]. Finally, monovalent TfR shuttles may require extended half-lives (e.g., through Fc fusion or PEGylation) to achieve therapeutically relevant brain exposures, which adds complexity and potential immunogenicity.

### CD98hc (SLC3A2): Enhanced Kinetics and Extended Brain Retention

CD98 heavy chain (CD98hc, also designated SLC3A2 or 4F2), the obligate binding partner of large neutral amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1), has recently emerged as an exceptionally promising alternative to TfR for brain-targeted delivery[2][5][7]. Unlike TfR, which mediates relatively rapid internalization and recycling, CD98hc engages in a distinct trafficking pathway that results in markedly prolonged brain retention following systemic administration[2][5]. In comparative pharmacokinetic studies using humanized CD98hc knock-in mice and non-human primates (cynomolgus monkeys), antibody transport vehicles (ATVs) targeting CD98hc exhibited brain concentrations that remained significantly elevated—7- to 12-fold above control—at 21 days post-dose, whereas anti-TfR ATVs exhibited rapid clearance with undetectable brain concentrations by day 7[2][5]. This extended kinetic profile provides a substantial advantage for therapeutic applications, as sustained brain exposure may enable improved efficacy with less frequent dosing regimens.

The mechanisms underlying CD98hc's superior brain retention differ markedly from TfR dynamics. CD98hc-mediated transcytosis involves internalization through clathrin-coated pits followed by trafficking through early endosomal compartments; however, the subsequent trafficking fate appears to favor a more prolonged recycling pathway rather than rapid lysosomal degradation[2][5][7]. Furthermore, the valency of CD98hc binding significantly influences both peripheral clearance and brain kinetics; bispecific anti-CD98hc constructs clear more slowly from plasma and exhibit higher brain concentrations compared to monovalent variants, an effect that contrasts with the superiority of monovalent TfR shuttles[2][5]. This suggests that the bispecific CD98hc format may activate distinct endosomal sorting pathways that promote transcytosis rather than degradation, possibly through engagement of multiple CD98hc molecules or recruitment of specific adaptor proteins that facilitate recycling.

The biodistribution of anti-CD98hc antibodies within the CNS is notably distinct from anti-TfR shuttles. Comprehensive whole-brain imaging and single-cell RNA sequencing analysis revealed that anti-CD98hc ATVs achieve strong localization to both vascular and parenchymal cell types, with particularly high accumulation in astrocytes and their perivascular endfeet, where CD98hc expression is enriched[29]. This preferential astrocytic targeting may be therapeutically advantageous for diseases involving glial pathology, such as neuroinflammatory disorders. In contrast, anti-TfR ATVs show stronger but less selective neuronal and astrocytic localization with more limited targeting to endothelial and immune cell populations[29].

The peripheral expression profile of CD98hc presents a more favorable selectivity window compared to TfR. While CD98hc is expressed broadly in tissues including lung, spleen, pancreas, and testis, its expression pattern is less ubiquitously elevated in tissues dependent on iron metabolism, and the absence of classical endocytic competition from a high-serum-concentration endogenous ligand reduces the peripheral sink effect[2][5][45]. Moreover, systemic targeting of CD98hc through anti-CD98hc antibody treatment did not affect total brain expression levels, subcellular localization of the transporter, or the level of amino acid transport in vivo, suggesting that anti-CD98hc shuttles may offer a more benign safety profile with respect to target-mediated perturbation of endogenous physiological function[2][5][7][45]. Proof-of-concept bispecific anti-CD98hc shuttles designed to co-engage the beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) as a second therapeutic arm achieved 30–40% reduction in brain amyloid-beta levels, confirming penetration of bispecific molecules into the brain parenchyma[45].

However, CD98hc-based platforms retain limitations for certain applications. The slower brain clearance, while advantageous for sustained exposure, may complicate the development of rapid-acting therapeutics or molecules requiring faster brain clearance to minimize side effects[2][5][7]. Additionally, high levels of CD98hc expression in the spleen and lungs raise theoretical concerns regarding off-target effects in immune tissues, particularly given the role of LAT1 in lymphocyte proliferation and function[9][45]. The optimal affinity and valency for anti-CD98hc shuttles differs from TfR approaches, and the landscape of engineering parameters remains less extensively mapped than for TfR, potentially requiring greater optimization effort for each novel therapeutic program.

### IGF1R: Moderate Efficiency and Potential Functional Liabilities

Insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) represents a third-tier BBB transport target, one that exhibits intermediate performance between TfR and CD98hc while carrying distinct limitations related to downstream signaling and systemic physiology[3][6][38][45]. IGF1R is a receptor tyrosine kinase that mediates cell growth and survival signaling upon ligand engagement; single-domain antibodies (VHHs or "Nanobodies") targeting IGF1R were identified through phage display screening and subsequently engineered to promote BBB crossing through receptor-mediated transcytosis. These IGF1R-targeting VHHs, such as IGF1R5 and VHH-IR5, bind to the extracellular domain of IGF1R without triggering classical downstream signaling (phosphorylation of AKT and other kinase cascades), thereby serving as transcytosis-competent binders that avoid unwanted target activation[3][6].

When fused to an Fc domain or extended through strategic conjugation, anti-IGF1R VHHs achieve moderate brain exposure in rodent and non-human primate models[3][6][38]. Proof-of-concept studies demonstrated that IGF1R5-Fc or IGF1R5-mFc fusion proteins could deliver pharmacologically active neuropeptide payloads (neurotensin and galanin) across the BBB in vivo, inducing dose-dependent hypothermia and analgesia as functional readouts of CNS bioavailability[3][6]. Capillary depletion assays confirmed that IGF1R-targeting carriers penetrated into the brain parenchymal fraction, indicating true transcytosis rather than sequestration within the endothelial compartment[3][6].

Despite these proof-of-concept successes, IGF1R faces substantial limitations that have constrained its adoption relative to TfR and CD98hc platforms[9][38][45]. First, IGF1R is heavily glycosylated with multiple N-linked glycosylation sites in its extracellular domain, which can provide steric hindrance for antibody binding and complicate epitope accessibility[45]. Second, IGF1R mediates essential physiological processes including growth factor signaling, glucose metabolism regulation, and cell survival pathways; non-selective targeting of IGF1R with high-affinity antibodies risks systemic insulin resistance, hypoglycemia, and disruption of growth factor signaling in peripheral tissues[9][38][45]. Indeed, long-term anti-IGF1R therapy has been associated with hyperglycemia and metabolic dysfunction in clinical contexts, suggesting that BBB-crossing anti-IGF1R scaffolds may carry similar liabilities if systemic exposure is not carefully controlled. Third, the peripheral tissue expression of IGF1R is ubiquitous, and the presence of high serum concentrations of endogenous IGF-1 and IGF-2 creates a competitive binding environment that limits synthetic IGF1R-targeted agents' engagement with the receptor[9][38]. Finally, comparative studies indicate that IGF1R-mediated brain uptake is substantially lower than both TfR and CD98hc platforms on a per-molecule basis, potentially necessitating higher systemic doses to achieve therapeutically relevant CNS concentrations[9][38][45].

The trafficking fate of anti-IGF1R antibodies differs intriguingly from both TfR and CD98hc. Whereas TfR and CD98hc undergo transcytosis with subsequent abluminal release, IGF1R-targeting antibodies appear to be predominantly recycled back to the apical membrane (luminal side) following endocytosis, suggesting that this receptor may not be optimally suited for transcytosis of all payload types[28][38]. This bias toward apical recycling may reflect IGF1R's structural properties, its association with distinct clathrin adaptor complexes, or inherent endosomal sorting signals that direct IGF1R-antibody complexes toward recycling endosomal compartments in a manner distinct from TfR[28][38].

## Emerging and Alternative Blood-Brain Barrier Transport Targets

### Carbonic Anhydrase IV: A Primate-Conserved, Endothelial-Enriched Target

Carbonic anhydrase IV (CA-IV), a recently validated BBB transport target with exceptional promise for translational development, has emerged from large-scale directed evolution screens of engineered adeno-associated virus (AAV) capsids[46][51][54]. CA-IV is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored enzyme localized to the luminal surface of brain endothelial cells, where it catalyzes the rapid conversion of carbon dioxide to bicarbonate and protons, thereby regulating acid-base balance and cerebral blood flow[46][51][54]. Notably, CA-IV exhibits a primate-conserved expression pattern and sequence, a property that distinguishes it from LY6A and LY6C1 (the LY6 family proteins previously identified as AAV BBB receptors), which are murine-restricted and absent in humans[46][51][54]. This primate conservation dramatically enhances the translational potential of CA-IV as a BBB target, as it suggests that engineered therapeutics binding human CA-IV will exhibit predictable cross-reactivity with primate orthologs, facilitating preclinical efficacy studies in non-human primates before advancing to human clinical trials.

The discovery of CA-IV as a BBB transport receptor emerged from a systematic approach combining machine learning-guided capsid engineering, AlphaFold-based structural modeling, and comprehensive receptor screening against a curated pool of brain endothelial cell-enriched protein targets[46][54]. Directed evolution of AAV capsids originally selected for enhanced CNS tropism in mice revealed that a subset of engineered capsids (such as AAV variants 9P31 and 9P36) exhibited enhanced transduction in LY6A-deficient mouse strains (such as BALB/cJ mice), suggesting the engagement of alternative BBB receptors[46][54]. Through high-throughput purified protein binding assays, in vitro cell culture selection, and in vivo validation in humanized transgenic mice expressing human CA-IV, researchers identified CA-IV as a potent BBB transcytosis receptor distinct from LY6 family members[46][51][54]. Notably, engineered AAV capsids targeting human CA-IV achieved dramatic enhancements in brain transduction—up to 100-fold greater than AAV9—with robust neuronal and astrocytic coverage across multiple brain regions in transgenic mice expressing the human ortholog[51].

The structural biology of CA-IV-mediated transcytosis offers insight into potential mechanisms. AlphaFold-Multimer computational modeling of capsid-receptor interactions revealed that engineered peptide motifs on the AAV capsid surface engage surface-exposed regions of the CA-IV ectodomain with nanomolar-to-picomolar affinities[46][51][54]. The structural flexibility of CA-IV's surface, combined with the multiple avidity-enhancing contacts provided by the pentavalent or icosahedral AAV capsid architecture, enabled highly specific and efficient receptor engagement. Critically, the epitope on CA-IV recognized by brain-tropic AAV capsids differs markedly from the substrate-binding pocket and catalytic site of the enzyme, a finding that suggests high-affinity CA-IV targeting can be achieved without disrupting the enzyme's catalytic function or its role in acid-base homeostasis[46][51][54]. This property addresses a key safety liability that would accompany targeting of other enzymes or multi-functional transporters.

The peripheral expression pattern of CA-IV presents a favorable selectivity profile compared to TfR, CD98hc, and IGF1R. Carbonic anhydrase IV is expressed predominantly at the blood-tissue interfaces where vascular permeability is naturally high, including the lung capillaries, kidney glomeruli, and intestinal vasculature[46][51][54]. Critically, CA-IV expression is restricted to endothelial cells in these tissues and does not show broad expression in rapidly proliferating or metabolically active peripheral tissues comparable to TfR's expression pattern in reticulocytes and hematopoietic progenitors[46][51][54]. Furthermore, the endogenous ligand for CA-IV is the bicarbonate/CO2 system, which is omnipresent rather than confined to a specific molecular species analogous to transferrin or IGF-1; consequently, there is minimal competition from an endogenous ligand for receptor occupancy by synthetic anti-CA-IV therapeutics[46][54]. The peripheral sink effect is therefore expected to be minimal, and systemic targeting of CA-IV should not disrupt the physiologic pH regulation and substrate-product cycling mediated by the enzyme in peripheral tissues.

However, several important caveats and knowledge gaps remain regarding CA-IV as a BBB target. To date, CA-IV-mediated transcytosis has been extensively characterized using engineered AAV capsids but has not yet been systematically validated using antibody or antibody-like shuttle molecules[46][51][54]. The geometry and stoichiometry of receptor engagement by large molecules such as antibodies (approximately 150 kDa) may differ substantially from that of pentavalent AAV capsids (approximately 60 nm icosahedral particles with multiple capsid protein contacts per particle), raising questions about whether optimal anti-CA-IV antibody designs can recapitulate the high-efficiency transcytosis achieved by engineered AAVs. Second, the relatively recent identification of CA-IV as a BBB receptor means that the kinetics of CA-IV-mediated transcytosis—including rates of internalization, endosomal sorting, recycling, and abluminal exocytosis—remain incompletely characterized for large molecules, contrasting with the decades of mechanistic data available for TfR and CD98hc[46][51][54]. Third, while CA-IV sequence conservation across primates is favorable, the specific epitope regions of human CA-IV that promote transcytosis of antibodies or other large molecule cargos remain to be identified through iterative structure-guided engineering or directed evolution approaches. Finally, the therapeutic potential of CA-IV-based shuttles remains to be validated in disease models; proof-of-concept therapeutic efficacy data (e.g., reduction of amyloid-beta in Alzheimer's models, or correction of lysosomal storage enzyme deficiency) await demonstration.

### LRP-1 and LDLR: Lipoprotein Receptor Family as Underutilized BBB Targets

The low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP-1), a member of the LDL receptor family, and the classical LDL receptor (LDLR) represent an underexplored and underutilized class of BBB transport targets with strong mechanistic foundations and favorable translational properties[13][16][21][38][45]. LRP-1 mediates endocytosis of a broad spectrum of ligands, including apolipoprotein E (ApoE), tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), alpha-2-macroglobulin, and numerous other proteins, through a mechanism distinct from both TfR and CD98hc[13][16][21][38]. Critically, LRP-1-mediated transcytosis occurs through a non-acidifying pathway; LRP-1-cargo complexes are internalized via clathrin-mediated endocytosis and trafficked through endosomal compartments that do not undergo substantial acidification, thereby avoiding lysosomal degradation and enabling efficient cargo release into the brain parenchyma[13][16][21]. This property stands in marked contrast to TfR, where pH-dependent release is essential for avoiding degradation, and provides a mechanistic advantage for cargo retention and biological activity in the CNS.

The proof-of-concept for LRP-1-mediated BBB crossing was elegantly demonstrated using pH-sensitive polymersomes (synthetic amphiphilic copolymer-based vesicles) engineered to target LRP-1 and loaded with immunoglobulin G (IgG) as a model cargo[13][16][21]. Following systemic administration, fluorescently-labeled IgG-loaded polymersomes underwent LRP-1-mediated transcytosis, crossed the BBB into the brain parenchyma, and achieved accumulation within neurons and glial cells, demonstrating true intracellular delivery[13][16][21]. Importantly, the brain accumulation of LRP-1-targeted polymersomes was approximately 30-fold greater than control polymersomes lacking LRP-1 targeting ligands (Angiopep-2, a dodecapeptide mimetic of ApoE that engages LRP-1), indicating substantial transport efficiency. Moreover, radioactive labeling and microvessel depletion studies confirmed that LRP-1-mediated uptake resulted in significant parenchymal localization rather than sequestration in the endothelial compartment[13][16][21].

The clinical validation of LRP-1-based delivery approaches is advancing through the development of peptide-based targeting ligands, including Angiopep-2, which has entered clinical development for CNS drug delivery[21][38][45]. Angiopep-2-decorated nanoparticles and Angiopep-2-conjugated small-molecule drugs have demonstrated enhanced brain penetration in multiple preclinical disease models. The LRP-1 receptor is expressed at high levels on brain endothelial cells, and its expression at the luminal (blood-facing) surface is well-characterized, making it an accessible target for systemically administered therapeutics[21][38][45]. The endosomal trafficking of LRP-1-ligand complexes is well-understood at the molecular level, with detailed mechanistic models available to guide engineering of new carriers and cargos[21][38][45].

However, LRP-1 faces specific limitations that have constrained its development relative to TfR and CD98hc[9][38][45]. First, LRP-1 is abundantly expressed in peripheral tissues, including the liver, kidney, and bone marrow, creating a peripheral sink effect analogous to that observed for TfR[9][38][45]. The liver, in particular, avidly internalizes LRP-1-targeted therapeutics, reducing the fraction of systemically administered agent available for BBB engagement[9][38][45]. Second, LRP-1 mediates endocytosis of a large and diverse portfolio of endogenous ligands, including ApoE, tPA, and other extracellular proteins; these endogenous ligands, particularly ApoE in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood, compete with synthetic LRP-1 targeting ligands for receptor occupancy, potentially reducing BBB penetration efficiency[9][38][45]. Third, LRP-1 signaling and its role in inflammation, immune regulation, and neuroinflammatory responses raises concerns about potential functional perturbation through chronic or high-dose LRP-1-targeted therapy; activation of LRP-1 can induce downstream signaling via multiple pathways, including JAK-STAT and NF-κB cascades[9][38][45]. Fourth, affinity tuning of LRP-1 ligands requires careful optimization, as inadequate affinity may result in insufficient receptor engagement, while excessive affinity risks lysosomal co-internalization with other LRP-1 cargo and degradation. Finally, the species orthology of LRP-1 epitopes targeted by engineered binders remains somewhat uncertain; while LRP-1 sequence conservation across mammalian species is reasonably high, functional epitopes recognized by synthetic antibodies or peptides may not be fully conserved, complicating translation from rodent preclinical studies to human clinical applications.

## Alternative Delivery Approaches: Exosome-Based and Engineered Viral Vector Platforms

Beyond target-specific receptor-mediated strategies, emerging alternative approaches to BBB crossing have demonstrated promise and merit consideration as components of next-generation delivery platforms. Exosome-based delivery systems represent a biomimetic approach that leverages the natural tropism of cell-derived extracellular vesicles for CNS penetration[50][53]. Exosomes are 30–150 nm lipid bilayer-enclosed vesicles derived from the endosomal system and naturally released by cells; they contain proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids derived from their parent cells and are recognized as valuable nanocarriers for therapeutic delivery[53]. Critically, exosomes can traverse the BBB through receptor-mediated mechanisms as well as through adsorptive-mediated transcytosis; the scavenger receptor class B type 1 (SR-B1) has been identified as a primary mechanism of exosome uptake and transcytosis across brain endothelial cells[27][30][50][53]. Exosomes derived from different cell types retain the surface properties dictated by their cellular origin, enabling cell-specific targeting; for instance, exosomes derived from cancer cells preferentially accumulate in brain tumors through homotypic cell-cell adhesion mechanisms[53]. Novel engineering approaches combine exosomes with fusogenic lipid nanoparticles (cubosomes) to enable rapid and non-destructive loading of large therapeutic molecules, including proteins and mRNA, while preserving the BBB-crossing capability of the exosomal carrier[50].

Engineered adeno-associated virus (AAV) platforms represent a second major alternative approach with extensive recent progress in BBB targeting. The discovery that engineered AAV capsids can be directly targeted to specific BBB receptor proteins—through directed evolution coupled with computational structure prediction—has enabled the generation of engineered AAVs with dramatically enhanced CNS tropisms across multiple animal species[39][41][42][43][51]. These engineered AAVs, such as those targeting CA-IV or the murine LY6A/LY6C1 proteins, achieve 100-fold or greater enhancements in brain transduction compared to natural AAV9 serotypes, with broad neuronal and glial cell coverage[39][42][43][51]. The prospect of engineering human CA-IV-targeting AAVs for clinical CNS gene therapy applications represents a promising near-term translational pathway[51]. Importantly, AAV-based approaches provide the advantage of integrating therapeutic transgene delivery with BBB penetration in a single molecular platform, avoiding the complexity of separate shuttle and cargo molecules[39][42][51].

## Comparative Analysis and Selection of Two Next-Generation BBB Transport Targets

Based on comprehensive analysis of the established targets (TfR, CD98hc, IGF1R) and emerging alternatives, two next-generation BBB transport targets emerge as particularly promising for antibody-based therapeutic development: carbonic anhydrase IV (CA-IV) and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP-1). These targets were selected through a systematic evaluation matrix that weighted three major criteria: (1) delivery efficiency and brain exposure potential; (2) selectivity and safety, including peripheral expression patterns and risk of target function perturbation; and (3) translational feasibility, encompassing species cross-reactivity, affinity tuning requirements, and manufacturability.

Carbonic anhydrase IV satisfies the selection criteria through multiple critical advantages. First, CA-IV offers exceptional primate conservation and brain endothelial specificity, properties that directly address the translational challenge that has confounded many murine-directed BBB targets; the fact that engineered AAV capsids targeting human CA-IV achieve superior CNS tropism in humanized transgenic models strongly predicts that anti-CA-IV antibodies will exhibit favorable cross-reactivity between rodent, primate, and human orthologs[46][51][54]. Second, CA-IV is not subject to competition from high-concentration endogenous ligands (unlike TfR with transferrin or IGF1R with IGF-1), eliminating a major source of peripheral sink effects and receptor occupancy limitation[46][51][54]. Third, the catalytic activity of CA-IV can be preserved through precise epitope selection, as demonstrated by the fact that engineered AAV capsids engaging CA-IV do not disrupt enzyme catalysis, suggesting that high-affinity antibody shuttles can similarly avoid functional perturbation[46][51][54]. Fourth, the moderate peripheral expression of CA-IV (limited to specialized vascular beds and not broadly distributed across rapidly proliferating tissues) suggests that systemic anti-CA-IV therapy will not create a substantial peripheral sink comparable to TfR in hematopoietic tissues[46][51][54]. The primary limitations of CA-IV are the nascent stage of mechanistic characterization for antibody-based versus AAV-based shuttles, and the requirement for new antibody engineering campaigns to identify optimal epitopes and affinity/avidity strategies for CA-IV targeting.

Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 satisfies selection criteria through distinct advantages in endosomal trafficking and mechanistic clarity. First, LRP-1 mediates non-acidifying transcytosis, a property that fundamentally distinguishes it from TfR and eliminates the necessity for pH-dependent affinity engineering; this simplification substantially reduces the complexity of developing LRP-1-based shuttles compared to optimizing TfR approaches that require careful tuning of pH-dependent binding[13][16][21][38]. Second, the mechanistic foundation for LRP-1-mediated BBB crossing is exceptionally well-established through decades of biochemical, cell biological, and structural studies, including high-resolution X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy data on LRP-1 ectodomain structure and ligand recognition; this mechanistic clarity enables rational structure-guided engineering of optimized anti-LRP-1 shuttle antibodies[13][16][21][38]. Third, LRP-1's endosomal trafficking pathway has been dissected at the molecular level, revealing that the receptor associates with specific adaptor proteins, phosphorylation sites, and ubiquitination events that direct cargo toward recycling rather than degradation pathways; these insights can be leveraged to engineer cargo molecules that inherently exploit LRP-1 trafficking for optimal transcytosis[13][16][21][38]. Fourth, clinical precedent exists for LRP-1-targeted therapeutics through Angiopep-2-based approaches, providing a foundation of safety and efficacy data that accelerates translation of new anti-LRP-1 antibody shuttles[21][38][45]. The major limitations of LRP-1 are the substantial peripheral tissue expression, particularly hepatic expression, which creates a significant sink effect; the competition from endogenous ligands such as ApoE and tPA; and the need for careful affinity optimization to balance adequate BBB uptake with minimized peripheral retention[9][38][45].

The comparative performance matrix reveals that both CA-IV and LRP-1 address distinct limitations of the established TfR, CD98hc, and IGF1R platforms (Table 1). CA-IV excels in translational feasibility and safety profile, while LRP-1 offers mechanistic clarity and established clinical precedent. Together, these two targets represent complementary approaches to next-generation CNS drug delivery: CA-IV through a structure-informed, newly validated mechanism with exceptional primate conservation; LRP-1 through a refined, mechanistically well-understood pathway with clinical proof-of-concept.

## Proposed Antibody-Based Delivery Strategies for Next-Generation Targets

### Strategy 1: CA-IV-Targeted Bispecific Antibody Shuttles with Optimized Epitope Engagement

For carbonic anhydrase IV, we propose a bispecific antibody shuttle format in which one arm of a human IgG1 backbone engages a carefully selected epitope on human CA-IV that promotes efficient transcytosis, while a second arm engages a CNS disease target such as amyloid-beta, tau, or a neuroinflammatory receptor. This "2+1" bispecific architecture (two therapeutic arms targeting disease-specific antigens on one CAR, one CA-IV-binding arm) contrasts with the more commonly employed "1+1" balanced bispecific format and is chosen based on several mechanistic principles.

The CA-IV-binding arm should be engineered as a monovalent single-chain variable fragment (scFv) or complementary-determining region (CDR) fusion to the Fc region, rather than a full-length IgG domain pair or bivalent architecture, to minimize receptor crosslinking and promote optimal endosomal sorting[8][11][46][51]. Crosslinking of CA-IV by bivalent engagement risks aberrant signaling or sequestration in non-productive endosomal compartments, whereas monovalent engagement is expected to promote efficient transcytosis by engaging the receptor without excessive avidity-driven stabilization. The specific epitope on CA-IV recognized by the anti-CA-IV scFv should be selected through a combination of structural modeling (using AlphaFold-Multimer and cryo-EM data on CA-IV structure) and directed evolution approaches to identify epitopes that are: (i) surface-accessible on the luminal (blood-facing) aspect of the CA-IV ectodomain; (ii) distal to the catalytic site and substrate-binding pocket, thereby preserving CA-IV enzymatic function; (iii) capable of supporting nanomolar to picomolar affinity binding while maintaining pH-independent kinetics (unlike TfR, LRP-1 transcytosis does not benefit from pH-dependent release, and CA-IV transcytosis similarly should favor pH-independent binding to avoid lysosomal co-routing of intact transcytosis intermediates).

The therapeutic arm of the bispecific construct should be engineered as a full-length IgG domain pair (VH + VL in a conventional 1+1 format) targeting the disease-relevant antigen. For example, in Alzheimer's disease applications, the therapeutic arm might be a BACE1-targeting or amyloid-beta-targeting antibody analogous to approved monoclonal antibodies (aducanumab, lecanemab, donanemab). Critically, the therapeutic arm should be designed with similar pH-independent kinetics as the CA-IV arm to ensure that the entire bispecific complex remains intact during endosomal trafficking and achieves coordinated abluminal release.

The bispecific architecture should be generated using "knob-into-hole" technology or CrossMab engineering to ensure proper heavy-chain pairing, minimize assembly errors, and reduce heterogeneous disulfide bonding[49]. This format provides several advantages over single-chain bispecific designs: (i) flexibility to optimize the stoichiometry and spacing of the CA-IV and therapeutic binding arms; (ii) retention of the Fc region's inherent capabilities (antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, complement activation, extended half-life through FcRn binding); (iii) compatibility with GMP manufacturing processes and scale-up; (iv) potential for incorporation of Fc mutations to modulate FcγR engagement (e.g., L234A/L235A/P329G mutations to eliminate Fc effector functions and minimize potential off-target immune activation in peripheral tissues while promoting CA-IV-mediated BBB crossing)[29].

Affinity optimization for the CA-IV-binding arm should target an intermediate affinity range (KD approximately 1–10 nM) based on the following rationale: lower affinity (KD > 100 nM) risks insufficient receptor occupancy and inadequate BBB uptake, while higher affinity (KD < 1 pM) may promote excessive stabilization of the CA-IV-antibody complex within endosomal compartments and favor sorting toward degradative pathways rather than transcytosis. This intermediate affinity range has been empirically validated for TfR and CD98hc shuttles and is predicted to apply similarly to CA-IV, though mechanism-specific variations may necessitate iterative optimization. The affinity can be modulated through rational CDR engineering, using the framework regions of a validated CA-IV-binding antibody scaffold and iteratively optimizing CDR sequences through yeast display, phage display, or ribosome display platforms to explore the sequence space of improved binders[56][59].

Validation of the proposed CA-IV bispecific shuttle should employ a staged in vitro to in vivo pipeline: (1) humanized CA-IV-expressing brain endothelial cell models (hCMEC/D3 or immortalized human brain endothelial cells transfected with human CA-IV cDNA) to assess transcytosis rates, internalization kinetics, and endosomal sorting via transwell assays and fluorescent tracking; (2) microphysiological 3D BBB-on-chip models incorporating human brain microvascular endothelial cells, pericytes, and astrocytes to evaluate transcytosis in a more physiologically relevant multicellular context[27][30]; (3) mouse studies using humanized CA-IV knock-in models (conditional expression of human CA-IV in brain endothelial cells via inducible transgenic approaches) to assess in vivo BBB penetration, brain kinetics, and peripheral biodistribution using quantitative PK studies with radioactive labeling (e.g., 125I labeling) and capillary depletion to distinguish vascular from parenchymal brain fractions; (4) non-human primate studies in cynomolgus monkeys to evaluate species-appropriate ortholog engagement, pharmacokinetics, brain exposure, and safety profiling prior to first-in-human clinical trials. Each validation stage should measure quantitative endpoints including Papp (apparent permeability across endothelial monolayers), brain-to-plasma concentration ratios, absolute brain concentrations (%ID/g or nM), and anatomical distribution within brain parenchyma using autoradiography or fluorescence microscopy.

### Strategy 2: LRP-1-Targeted Monovalent Shuttle with Low-Affinity Variant Engineering

For low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1, we propose a monovalent anti-LRP-1 shuttle in a "1+1" bispecific format, where one arm is a monovalent anti-LRP-1 binder and the second arm is a conventional bivalent therapeutic antibody targeting a CNS disease antigen. This format differs from the CA-IV strategy by employing monovalent engagement of the BBB target (LRP-1) while maintaining full bivalent engagement of the therapeutic target; the rationale is grounded in LRP-1's known propensity to undergo rapid recycling and its insensitivity to bivalent crosslinking effects that dominate TfR trafficking.

The anti-LRP-1 binding arm should be engineered as a conventional scFv or as a single-domain antibody (VHH) fused to the Fc region of the bispecific antibody. Unlike the CA-IV approach, where intermediate affinity is proposed, LRP-1 targeting benefits from a low-to-intermediate affinity strategy (KD approximately 10–100 nM range) based on the following mechanistic considerations: LRP-1 undergoes constitutive, rapid recycling between the plasma membrane and endosomal compartments; excessively high-affinity binders may become "trapped" during the recycling cycle and accumulate in peripheral tissues (liver, kidney) rather than crossing the BBB[9][38][45]. Low-affinity binding is predicted to promote kinetically favorable off-rates that facilitate abluminal release and minimize peripheral retention. This affinity strategy contrasts with both TfR (where intermediate-to-low affinity tuned to pH 5.5 is optimal) and CD98hc (where bivalent high-affinity engagement is favorable), demonstrating the receptor-specific nature of optimal shuttle design.

The epitope recognized by the anti-LRP-1 binder should be selected to engage a region of the LRP-1 ectodomain that is surface-accessible on the luminal membrane of brain endothelial cells and distinct from the major ligand-binding sites for endogenous ligands (ApoE, tPA, etc.). This epitope selection strategy aims to minimize competition from endogenous ligands while preserving the receptor's capacity for ligand engagement at sites not blocked by the therapeutic antibody. Structural studies of LRP-1 ectodomain fragments in complex with antibodies can guide epitope selection and provide insights into optimal binding geometries[21][38][45].

The therapeutic arm of the LRP-1-targeted bispecific should be a conventional bivalent antibody targeting a relevant CNS disease antigen. In the context of Alzheimer's disease, this arm might target amyloid-beta, phosphorylated tau, or neuroinflammatory targets (IL-6, TNF-alpha, or microglial activation markers). In the context of lysosomal storage diseases, this arm might engage neurotrophin receptors, growth factor receptors, or other targets relevant to neuroprotection or activation of endogenous clearance pathways.

Affinity maturation and developability optimization for the LRP-1-binding arm can leverage the extensive existing knowledge base on LRP-1 binding to peptide and protein ligands. Since multiple structures of LRP-1 ectodomain in complex with peptide and protein ligands have been solved through X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM, rational structure-guided design approaches can be applied to engineer improved anti-LRP-1 binders with optimized epitope contacts while maintaining the desired low-to-intermediate affinity range[21][38][45]. Alternatively, directed evolution approaches using phage display or yeast display libraries can be employed to sample diverse anti-LRP-1 binding variants and select for those exhibiting both favorable affinity (KD ~10–100 nM) and biophysical properties (stability, solubility, aggregation resistance)[21][38].

The bispecific architecture should employ knob-into-hole or CrossMab engineering to ensure proper heavy-chain heterodimerization. As with the CA-IV strategy, Fc mutations (L234A/L235A/P329G) can be incorporated to minimize Fc effector functions and reduce peripheral immune activation, thereby lowering the peripheral sink effect and improving BBB penetration[29]. Additionally, the anti-LRP-1 scFv or VHH can be strategically positioned at the N-terminus versus C-terminus of the Fc region, or alternatively formatted as a separate Fab fragment in a trispecific configuration (2+1 with two therapeutic arms and one LRP-1-targeting arm), to optimize endosomal trafficking and minimize steric hindrance.

Validation of the LRP-1-targeted shuttle should employ a similar multi-stage pipeline as proposed for CA-IV, with particular emphasis on the role of the low-to-intermediate affinity in promoting transcytosis while minimizing peripheral retention. Specific validation experiments should include: (1) competitive binding assays in which the anti-LRP-1 shuttle is incubated with excess recombinant LRP-1 ectodomain and endogenous ligands (apoE, tPA) to assess epitope specificity and ligand competition[21][38][45]; (2) dynamic light scattering and analytical ultracentrifugation to characterize the hydrodynamic properties and oligomerization state of the bispecific shuttle in physiological buffers; (3) surface plasmon resonance (SPR) or bio-layer interferometry (BLI) kinetics studies to measure precise on-rates and off-rates for LRP-1 engagement, confirming the intended intermediate affinity profile; (4) cellular uptake assays using primary rat or human brain endothelial cells to assess LRP-1-mediated internalization and transcytosis rates in comparison to control antibodies and benchmark shuttles (anti-TfR or anti-CD98hc constructs); (5) quantitative PK studies in mice and non-human primates using radioactive labeling (125I) or fluorescent labeling (AlexaFluor), with particular attention to hepatic clearance kinetics and peripheral biodistribution in organs expressing LRP-1 (liver, kidney, bone marrow); (6) capillary depletion studies to quantify the fraction of parenchymal versus vascular brain accumulation; (7) pharmacodynamic readouts demonstrating that the therapeutic arm of the bispecific shuttle engages its intended CNS target (e.g., amyloid-beta reduction in Alzheimer's models, BACE1 target engagement, microglial activation markers in neuroinflammation models).

## Implementation Considerations and Regulatory Pathway

Both proposed strategies (CA-IV-targeted bispecific and LRP-1-targeted monovalent shuttle) represent substantial advances over current BBB-crossing approaches, yet each requires thoughtful implementation planning to navigate preclinical development, regulatory review, and clinical translation. For CA-IV-targeted shuttles, the key implementation milestone involves identification and validation of optimal epitopes that preserve enzyme function while supporting transcytosis. This milestone can be achieved through iterative rounds of: (i) computational epitope prediction using structural modeling; (ii) alanine-scanning mutagenesis of recombinant CA-IV to identify residues critical for both antibody binding and catalytic function; (iii) directed evolution of anti-CA-IV antibody libraries to identify binders recognizing the identified epitope; (iv) functional assays confirming that CA-IV enzymatic activity (measured via pH changes in bicarbonate buffering assays) is preserved upon antibody binding. These experiments should be executed in parallel across human, primate (cynomolgus or rhesus monkey), and rodent (mouse or rat) orthologs to ensure that selected epitopes support cross-species recognition and can enable translation from rodent preclinical models to primate pharmacology studies.

For LRP-1-targeted shuttles, the key implementation milestone involves identification of epitopes distinct from the major ligand-binding regions and optimization of the low-to-intermediate affinity to promote optimal transcytosis kinetics. This can be accomplished through: (i) structure-guided design using available X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM data on LRP-1 ectodomain and ligand complexes; (ii) computational docking of candidate antibody variable regions to identify geometrically favorable epitopes; (iii) affinity maturation screening to optimize the KD into the 10–100 nM range while maintaining favorable kinetic profiles (low off-rates to promote transcytosis, but not so tight as to promote endosomal trapping). The regulatory pathway for both candidates will require: (i) comprehensive preclinical safety pharmacology studies in rodents and non-human primates to identify any species-specific toxicities; (ii) manufacturing process development and analytical characterization demonstrating reproducible bispecific antibody production with minimal heterogeneity; (iii) comprehensive brain imaging studies (PET, fluorescence microscopy, or MRI with contrast-enhanced tracking) to visualize BBB penetration and brain distribution; (iv) target engagement studies in CNS disease models confirming that the bispecific shuttles achieve sufficient brain exposure to engage their therapeutic targets.

## Conclusion

The treatment of central nervous system diseases remains profoundly limited by the impermeability of the blood-brain barrier to most therapeutic molecules. Over the past two decades, receptor-mediated transcytosis has emerged as a physiologically-grounded and mechanistically sophisticated approach to overcome this barrier, with transferrin receptor, CD98 heavy chain, and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor serving as validated proof-of-concept targets. Nonetheless, each of these established platforms carries significant limitations regarding efficiency, specificity, peripheral tissue expression, safety, and translational feasibility. The emergence of carbonic anhydrase IV as a primate-conserved, endothelial-enriched BBB receptor validated through engineered AAV capsid studies, combined with the mechanistic clarity and clinical precedent surrounding LRP-1-mediated transcytosis, opens a new chapter in BBB-targeted drug delivery. We propose that next-generation antibody-based therapeutic development should prioritize: (i) CA-IV-targeted bispecific shuttles engineered with careful epitope selection and monovalent engagement strategies that preserve enzyme function while promoting efficient transcytosis; (ii) LRP-1-targeted monovalent shuttles employing low-to-intermediate affinity binding strategies that exploit the receptor's constitutive recycling and non-acidifying trafficking to promote sustained brain exposure without peripheral retention. These strategies, informed by detailed understanding of established target limitations, represent a substantive evolution toward safer, more efficient, and more translationally feasible BBB-crossing platforms for CNS therapeutics development.
