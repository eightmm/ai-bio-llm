Problem 3. [Identification of Next-Generation Antibody Targets to Overcome the Limitations of GLP-1R Agonists in Obesity Treatment]


Background
GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists have revolutionized the treatment of obesity, demonstrating unprecedented efficacy in body weight reduction. However, their clinical use is associated with significant limitations, including gastrointestinal adverse effects, nausea and vomiting, and loss of lean muscle mass. Moreover, GLP-1–based therapies do not fully address the complex compensatory physiological and metabolic pathways that counteract sustained weight loss.
Next-generation obesity therapeutics aim to go beyond simple weight reduction and instead focus on improving overall metabolic health while minimizing adverse effects. Achieving this goal requires a deeper understanding of the mechanistic limitations of GLP-1 signaling and the identification of novel therapeutic targets that can synergize with or complement GLP-1–based interventions.

Task
Analyze the mechanistic and clinical limitations of GLP-1R agonists and propose next-generation antibody-based therapeutic targets that could overcome these limitations.
1) Analysis of Limitations and Compensatory Pathways of GLP-1–Based Obesity Therapies
•	Identify the major clinical and mechanistic limitations of GLP-1R agonists
•	Analyze compensatory physiological and metabolic pathways linked to GLP-1 signaling
•	Propose key compensatory nodes that are:
o	Functionally relevant to obesity and metabolic regulation
o	Not sufficiently suppressed or modulated by GLP-1 alone
2) Proposal of Next-Generation Antibody Targets and Therapeutic Strategies
Based on your analysis:
•	Propose two novel therapeutic targets that could:
o	Act in mechanistic synergy with GLP-1
o	Or complement GLP-1 signaling to mitigate its limitations
•	Justify target selection based on:
o	Biological function
o	Pathway context
o	Expected impact on metabolic health and side-effect reduction
For each proposed target:
•	Specify the antibody modality (e.g., IgG, VHH, bispecific, combination therapy)
•	Describe the therapeutic strategy (e.g., GLP-1R agonist + novel antibody combination)
•	Discuss:
o	Expected improvements over GLP-1 monotherapy
o	Potential risks, trade-offs, or safety considerations

 
Problem 4. [Identification of Next-Generation Targets and Delivery Strategies to Enhance Antibody Transport Across the Blood–Brain Barrier (BBB)]


Background
One of the most significant technological challenges in the treatment of central nervous system (CNS) diseases is the Blood–Brain Barrier (BBB). The BBB severely restricts the entry of large molecules, and as a result, most antibodies and biologic therapeutics fail to achieve effective brain exposure.
Recent advances have explored strategies such as receptor-mediated transcytosis (RMT) to enhance BBB penetration, leveraging endogenous transport mechanisms. Several targets—most notably Transferrin Receptor (TfR), CD98hc (SLC3A2), and IGF1R—have been extensively studied as BBB shuttle targets. However, these approaches face important limitations related to efficiency, specificity, safety, and translational feasibility.
In this problem, you are asked to analyze existing BBB transport strategies and propose next-generation targets and antibody-based delivery approaches that could enable more effective CNS drug delivery.

Task
Based on existing literature and publicly available data, perform a comparative analysis of established BBB shuttle targets and propose two novel or emerging BBB transport targets or delivery approaches that are most promising for next-generation CNS therapeutics.
1) Analysis of Established BBB Transport Targets
Analyze the mechanisms and characteristics of representative BBB shuttle targets, including:
•	Transferrin Receptor (TfR)
•	CD98hc (SLC3A2)
•	IGF1R
Your analysis should include:
•	BBB transport mechanisms (e.g., receptor-mediated transcytosis)
•	Reported antibody- or ligand-based shuttle strategies
•	Known limitations, such as:
o	Limited brain exposure
o	Peripheral tissue expression and off-target effects
o	Safety concerns or functional perturbation
o	Challenges in affinity tuning or format optimization

2) Selection of Next-Generation BBB Transport Targets and Delivery Strategies
Excluding TfR, IGF1R, and CD98hc, propose two alternative BBB transport targets or approaches that you consider most promising for next-generation CNS drug delivery.
For each proposed target, compare it against established targets in terms of:
•	Efficiency
o	Expected increase in brain exposure or CNS delivery efficiency
•	Selectivity and Safety
o	Expression pattern in peripheral tissues
o	Risk of disrupting endogenous physiological functions
•	Translational Feasibility
o	Need for antibody affinity tuning
o	Species cross-reactivity (preclinical to clinical translation)
o	Manufacturability and format complexity

3) Antibody-Based Drug Delivery Strategy Design
For the selected targets, propose a drug delivery strategy, considering:
•	Antibody shuttle formats
o	Monospecific vs bispecific antibodies
•	Binding affinity strategies
o	Low-affinity vs high-affinity binding
o	Monovalent vs bivalent engagement
•	Payload considerations (optional)
Clearly explain how your proposed strategy addresses the limitations of existing BBB shuttle approaches.
